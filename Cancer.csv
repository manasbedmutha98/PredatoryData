186678, sec map section chunk R E S E A R C H Open Access The novel function of tumor protein D  in regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase and metformin cytotoxicity in breast cancer Yongxian Zhuang     Reynold C. Ly     Carleigh V. Frazier     Jia Yu     Sisi Qin     Xiao Yang Fan     Matthew P. Goetz     Judy C. Boughey     Richard Weinshilboum   and Liewei Wang    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  The role of tumor protein D  in breast cancer has not been studied and its function in breast cancer remains unclear. In our previous pharmacogenomic studies using lymphoblastoid cell line  LCL  this protein has been identified to affect metformin response. Although metformin has been widely studied as a prophylactic and chemotherapeutic drug  there is still a lack of biomarkers predicting the response to metformin in breast cancer. In this study  we revealed the novel function of TPD  in breast cancer through understanding how TPD  altered the cancer cell sensitivity to metformin. Methods  The role of TPD  in altering cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment was carried out by either knockdown or overexpression of TPD  followed by measuring cell viability and reactive oxygen species  ROS  production in MCF  breast cancer cell line and breast cancer patient derived xenografts. Functional analysis of TPD  in breast cancer cells was demonstrated by studying TPD  protein localization and identification of potential binding partners of TPD  through immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The effect of TPD  on pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  protein regulation was demonstrated by western blot  immunoprecipitation  and site directed mutagenesis. Results  TPD  inhibited colony formation and enhanced cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment in MCF  cells and breast cancer patient derived xenografts. Mechanistic study indicated that TPD  had mitochondrial localization  bound to and stabilized pyruvate dehydrogenase E  by blocking pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase    PDK mediated serine   phosphorylation. TPD  knockdown increased PDH E  protein degradation and led to decreased PDH enzyme activity  which reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species  ROS  production  thus contributing to the resistance of breast cancer cells to metformin treatment. Conclusion  We have discovered a novel mechanism by which TPD  regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and affects the sensitivity of breast cancer to metformin treatment. Our findings highlight the important post translational regulation of PDK  on PDH E  and the potential application of TPD  as a biomarker for selecting tumors that may be sensitive to metformin therapy. These provide new insights into understanding the regulation of PDH complexes and the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells to metformin treatment.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     https doi.org . s   chunk section section heading Background  heading chunk TPD  is a tumor protein which shares functional charac  teristics with tumor protein D   TPD       . TPD  has been reported to be amplified in breast  ovarian  and prostate cancers and has also been associated with poor prognosis  . Its known functions involve the regulation of cell proliferation and migration  . Recent studies have also shown that TPD  affects cell proliferation  cell adhesion  and invasion  . Furthermore  TPD  has been shown to have opposite effects to TPD  in oral squamous cell carcinoma  OSCC  by preventing colony formation and cell migration  . However  the underlying mecha  nisms of TPD s role in cancer  including breast cancer  remain unclear. Even less information is available with regard to its role in treatment response. We previously performed a pharmacogenomics study using lymphoblastoid cell lines  LCLs  to identify genes that might contribute to metformin response that included attempts to identify metformin response biomarkers and potential new regulators of pathways involved in metformin response    . One of the genes whose expression level was highly associated with metformin IC  in LCLs was the tumor protein D   TPD   p value   .       . One identified mechanism of metformins anticancer action is through the increased production of mitochon  drial reactive oxygen species  ROS  by inhibition of mito  chondrial complex I  . It has been shown that pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  activity can significantly affect reactive oxygen species production and cellular sensitivity to metformin associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  . The observation that tumor protein TPD  alters the cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment leads us to hypothesize that TPD  might be involved in the regulation of PDH related mito  chondrial function and cancer metabolism. Cancer cells are known to have metabolic alterations with higher glucose consumption and reduced oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria even under normoxic conditions to support the anabolic requirements for cell growth and proliferation  . Pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  is the key enzyme linking glycolysis and tricyclic acid cycle  TCA   . Emerging evidences suggest that cancer metabolic alterations may in part result from the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex      . PDH complex activity is mainly controlled by phosphoryl  ation and dephosphorylation of the PDH E  subunit at three different serine sites  S  S  and S . Phos  phorylation of PDH E  at serine   by PDK  is the most well known mechanism for PDH E  enzyme inactivation. The role of phosphorylation at serine   and serine   in enzyme inactivation is not well understood  . Four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases  PDK  PDK  PDK  and PDK  have been identified in mammalian cells which have varied catalytic activity toward PDH E . To date  only PDK  is known to phosphorylate PDH E  at serine   but its role in the regulation of enzyme activity is not well understood. In this study  we identified the interaction between TPD  and PDH by examining how TPD  affected cell sensitivity to metformin and further revealed that TPD  stabilized PDH E  protein by preventing PDK mediated phosphorylation. These findings will provide novel insights in understanding the role of TPD  in the regula  tion of PDH complex  cancer metabolic reprogramming  and the mechanisms of cancer resistance to metformin treatment.  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Cell lines The breast cancer cell lines  MCF  T D  BT  and MDA MB  were purchased from ATCC and main  tained in DMEM media containing   fetal bovine serum supplemented with   Gibco Antibiotic Antimycotic.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   showed that the re expression of TPD  increased metfor  min sensitivity in shTPD  cells  Additional file   Figure S B and C . To be sure the specificity of the siRNA and shRNA  another pair of control and shRNA targeting TPD  was purchased from Santa Cruz to further confirm that the TPD  knockdown could reduce metformin induced cell death after treatment for   days  Additional file   Figure S D and E . Metformin is known to inhibit mitochondrial complex I. To better understand the effect of TPD  on mitochondrial function  the control and shTPD  stable knockdown cells were treated with two other complex I inhibitors  piericidin A or rotenone  for   days  and the results demonstrated that the downreg  ulation of TPD  diminished cell sensitivity to those two complex I inhibitors as observed with metformin  Add  itional file   Figure S F and S G . Previously  metfor  min was shown to increase the production of reactive oxygen species  which contributed to metformins mechanism of cell death  . This prompted us to compare the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen spe  cies induced by metformin treatment in control and TPD  knockdown cells. We demonstrated that metformin could significantly induce ROS production in control cells  but TPD  knockdown partially blocked the induction of ROS production caused by metformin  Fig.  e  f . This sug  gests that TPD  might be involved in the regulation of ROS production induced by metformin  which in turn  could affect metformin cytotoxicity. In order to further confirm the correlation between TPD  and metformin response  next  we examined their relationship using different xenospheroids established from breast cancer patient derived xenograft tumors    . BJ  BJ  and BJ  were triple negative breast cancer  BJ  and BJ  were HER  and BJ  were ER  breast cancer. TPD  expression levels varied among different breast cancer xenospheroids. All lines with different expression levels of TPD  were treated with metformin. BJ  BJ  and BJ  had undetectable or low levels of TPD  compared to BJ  BJ  and BJ . Furthermore  BJ  BJ  and BJ  were relatively sensitive to metformin  BJ  BJ  and BJ  were resistant to metformin treatment even at high concentration of   mM  Fig.  g . Additionally  the overexpression of TPD  in BJ  could restore its sen  sitivity to metformin treatment  Fig.  h . These results indi  cate that TPD  is positively correlated with breast cancer sensitivity to metformin and may be used as a biomarker for predicting metformin response in breast cancer. TPD  interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase and plays an important role in breast cancer cells We have demonstrated that TPD  plays an important role in affecting cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment in breast cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts. However  little is known about its function in breast cancer  even less is known how it affects cell response to drug treatments. Therefore  we investigated its role in influ  encing cell proliferation and drug response in breast cancer cells. TPD  inhibited colony formation and cell proliferation in MCF  cells  Fig.  a  b  Additional file   Figure S A  B  which further confirmed its biological importance in breast cancer. As we have shown  TPD  knockdown partially blocked the induction of ROS pro  duction caused by metformin  Fig.  e  f  . This suggests that TPD  is likely to be involved in the regulation of metformin induced ROS production. Next  confocal microscopy was performed to examine the localization of TPD  in MCF  MDAMB  BT  and T D cells using DsRed Mito to label mitochondria  where the majority of ROS is produced. We found that TPD  was localized in the cytoplasm as well as mitochondria as demonstrated by images showing its co localization with dsRed labeled mitochondria  Fig.  c . The  bit grayscale of individual channel and overlap coefficient were presented in Additional file   Figure S C. To further verify TPD s mitochondrial localization  we performed western blot analysis using cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions. Western blot analysis confirmed that TPD  had both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial localization in MCF  cells  Fig.  d . These interesting findings that TPD  was localized in the mitochondria and involved in the regulation of ROS production supported our hypothesis that TPD  may play a role in cancer metabolism. Therefore  we immuno  precipitated TPD  in MCF  cells and performed mass spectrometry to identify TPD  interacting proteins. Two of the top identified proteins that are known to regulate cell metabolisms were pyruvate dehydrogenase A and B subunits  Additional file   Mass spectrometry results  sug  gesting a potential interaction between TPD  and the pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  complex. This interaction was validated by endogenous TPD  immunoprecipitation performed with MCF  cells  in which all subunits of PDH were detected in the immunoprecipitates  Fig.  e . Confocal microscopy further confirmed that TPD  interacted with the PDH complex by staining TPD  and PDH E  sub  unit in both MCF  and MDA MB  cells  Fig.  f . The  bit grayscale of individual channel and overlap coefficient were presented in Additional file   Figure S D. Collectively  these results support that TPD  interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase and their interaction might have an import  ant biological role in breast cancer. TPD  is positively correlated with PDHE  protein and PDH complex enzyme activity  and through it changes the sensitivity of cells to metformin Next  we tested whether the association between TPD  and PDH involved TPD  regulation of PDH function  which could alter phenotypes associated with cellular Zhuang et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   metabolism and ROS production. Mitochondrial ROS production is tightly associated with active mitochon  drial oxidative phosphorylation    . Therefore  we hypothesized that the interaction between TPD  and PDH might affect PDH activity and alter mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Knocking down TPD  de  creased ROS production  Fig.  e  f  was further confirmed by examining H AX phosphorylation  a marker of DNA damage  Fig.  a . Interestingly  we observed that the PDH complex  particularly E  alpha  had a reduced protein level in TPD  stably knocked down cells compared to controls  Fig.  a  which was also correlated with reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase complex enzyme activity  Fig.  b . The xenospheroid samples presented in Fig.  g were blotted for PDH complex as well. The level of PDC complex showed reduced expression pattern when TPD  levels were low across all the six samples  Additional file   Figure S A . PDH is an important enzyme responsible for controlling oxygen consumption  . Consistent with the reduction in enzyme activity  there was also a  .  reduction in oxygen consumption rate  OCR  when TPD  was knocked down  Fig.  c . Metformin reduced OCR by  .  in control cells  Fig.  d  while only  .  in TPD  stably knockdown cells  Fig.  e . We did not observe a significant difference in glycolysis either at the baseline or after metformin treatment between control and TPD  knockdown cells  Additional file   Figure S B  C and D . Metformin increased glycolysis in both con  trol and TPD  knockdown cells  and did not have effects on other non glycolysis induced extracellular acidification. These data collectively demonstrate that TPD  knockdown not only affects cellular oxygen consumption rate but also pre  vents metformin mediated inhibition of OCR  which could be the outcome of its direct regulation of PDH protein levels and activity. In order to answer these questions and to determine whether downregulation of TPD  caused decreased cellular sensitivity to metformin as a direct result of PDH activity  PDH upstream inhibitory kinase  PDK  the major kinase for serine   phosphorylation was knocked down in TPD  stable knockdown cells. We found that PDH activity was partially recovered as dem  onstrated by reduced PDH E  S  phosphorylation  Fig.  f  . In control cells  metformin increased cleaved PARP and decreased live cells  effects which were further enhanced by downregulating PDK   Fig.  g  h . In TPD  knockdown cells  metformins effect was reduced as repre  sented by decreased cleaved PARP and reduced cytotox  icity compared with control cells treated with metformin. Double knockdown of TPD  and PDK  compared with TPD  single knockdown resulted in increased levels of cleaved PARP and ROS production  as well as reduced live cells in the presence of metformin  Fig.  g  h .

DCA showed similar ef  fects as those observed with PDK  knockdown  in that it re  stored cell sensitivity to metformin in TPD  knockdown cells  Additional file   Figure S E . On the other hand  when the cells were treated with CoCl   to mimic the hyp  oxic conditions  metformin induced cell death was totally abolished in both control and shTPD  stable cells  Additional file   Figure S F . These results demon  strated that metformin resistance caused by TPD  knockdown was indeed the direct result of reduced PDH activity and reduced reactive oxidative species production. TPD  knockdown leads to increased PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   by PDK  followed by increased ubiquitination and protein degradation Considering the important role of PDH in cancer metabolic reprogramming  it is necessary to understand how TPD  regulates PDH E  protein level. We then examined the Fig.   TPD  is positively correlated with PDHE  protein and PDH complex enzyme activity  and through it changes the sensitivity of cells to metformin. a TPD  p H AX  and PDH complex were detected by western blot in control and TPD  stably knocked down cells treated with or without  mM metformin for   days. b PDH complex  PDC  enzyme activity was measured using cell lysates from cells described in a. shCon vs. shTPD  with p  lt   .  ce Oxygen consumption rate was measured using a Seahorse XFp analyzer for control and TPD  stably knocked down cells  c  in control cells treated with or without  mM metformin  d  and in TPD  stable knockdown cells treated with   PBS or   mM metformin  e . f Control and TPD  stably knocked down cells transfected with either control siRNA or siPDK  were treated with or without metformin for   days.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   effects of TPD  knockdown on PDH E  mRNA and protein degradation in MCF  cells. TPD  did not affect PDH E  mRNA level  Additional file   Figure S A  how  ever  we found that the addition of proteasome inhibitor  MG  compared to DMSO treatment  restored the de  creased PDH E  protein caused by TPD  knockdown  Fig.  a . This suggests that TPD  is involved in regulating PDH E  protein stability and its downregulation leads to increased PDH E  protein degradation and  in turn  reduced enzyme activity. Han et al.   reported that EGFR PTK mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDH E  protein led to post translational modification with enhanced ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation of the PDH E  subunit. It is likely that Fig.   TPD  knockdown leads to increased PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   by PDK  followed by increased ubiquitination and degradation. a PDH E  protein levels were detected by western blot in control and TPD  stably knocked down cells with either DMSO or MG    M  treatment for   day. b control and TPD  stably knocked down cells transfected with control siRNA or siPDK  were treated with metformin for   days.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   phosphorylation at individual PDH E  sites might have similar effects on the regulation of protein stability as that discovered for PDH E . There are four pyruvate dehydrogenases including PDK  PDK  PDK  and PDK  that can phosphorylate PDH E  with varied specificities  . We have shown that the downregulation of PDK  affects phosphorylation at serine site   and PDH enzyme activity  Fig.  f . To determine which PDK isoforms might have an effect on PDH stability through phosphorylation  we downregulated PDK  PDK  PDK  and PDK  individually and examined their effects on PDH E  protein levels. Interestingly  PDK  knockdown specifically restored PDH E  protein level in TPD  knockdown cells  Fig.  b . Since PDK  mainly phosphorylates the serine   site  we determined the ratio between PDH E  serine   phosphorylation and total PDH E  in TPD  knockdown cells. We found that TPD  knockdown increased the phosphorylation of PDH E  at serine   which was further reduced by downregulating PDK   Fig.  c . To further demonstrate that TPD  is involved in the regulation of PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   and the potential mecha  nisms involved in this regulation  immunoprecipitation of PDH E  was performed in TPD  knockdown cells and showed increased PDK  binding and increased PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   relative to PDH E  level compared with control cells  Fig.  d  indicating that TPD  might block PDK  interaction with PDH E  and  in turn  block the phosphorylation of PDH E . Since PDK  is the only known kinase to phosphorylate PDH E  at serine   PDK  was transiently downregulated with siRNA in TPD  stably knocked down cells  Fig.  e . PDK  knockdown increased the PDH E  protein level and reduced the ratio of phosphorylated S  PDH E  to total PDH E   Fig.  e . We observed reduced ubiquiti  nation and serine   phosphorylation of PDH E  when PDK  was knockdown in PDH E  immunoprecipitates  Fig.  e . We also determined the PDK  effect on met  formin cytotoxicity. In control cells  metformin increased cleaved PARP and decreased live cells  an effect which were further enhanced by downregulating PDK   Fig.  f  g . In TPD  knockdown cells  metformins effect was reduced compared with control cells treated with metformin. Double knockdown of TPD  and PDK  compared with TPD  knockdown alone resulted in increased levels of cleaved PARP and increased cytotoxicity in the presence of metformin  Fig.  f  g . These results suggest that the loss of TPD  leads to increased phosphorylation of PDH E  at serine   by PDK  resulting in increased PDH E  protein degradation. PDK  knockdown restores PDH E  protein level by reducing serine   phosphoryl  ation and subsequent ubiquitination of PDH E . To further elucidate the role of serine   phosphorylation in mediating PDH E  ubiquitination and protein degradation by TPD  PDH E  wild type and PDH E  S A mutant were transfected into TPD  stably knocked down cells. Immunoprecipitation of PDH E  was performed to examine ubiquitination levels. SNAP  tag antibody was used to detect overexpressed PDH E  wild type and S A mutant. The PDH E  S A  which cannot be phosphorylated  has reduced ubiquitination compared to wild type PDH E  in TPD  stably knocked down cells  Fig.  h  suggesting that PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   is required for ubiquitination. PDH E  subunit is known to be phosphorylated at three different serine sites  S  S  and S . Phosphorylation of PDH E  at serine   by PDK  is the most well known mechanism for PDH E  enzyme inactivation but there have been no reports of the involvement of additional phosphoryl  ation sites in the regulation of protein stability. The role of phosphorylation at PDH E  serine   and serine   are not well understood  . To date  PDH E  serine   is known to be phosphorylated only by PDK . PDH E  serine   can be specifically phos  phorylated by PDK  followed by PDK    and  . Since serine   can also be phosphorylated by PDK  we also tested whether this site might be involved in PDH E  degradation. In order to test this possibility  site directed mutagenesis was performed to create PDH E  mutants at all three known serine phosphorylation sites to examine the effects of TPD  knockdown on PDH E  stability. We overexpressed PDH E  wild type and three different PDH E  mutants  S A  S G  and S A fused with SNAP tag in MCF  cells. We then examined the protein changes of transfected PDH E  using SNAP tag antibody after transiently knocking down TPD . Transient TPD  knockdown reduced PDH E  wild type and S G mutant. The downregulation of TPD  did not significantly reduce protein levels of S A and S A mutants when compared with the WT and S G mutants  Fig.  i . In summary  PDK  phosphoryl  ation of PDH E  at serine   and   sites is important for further Ub dependent degradation of PDH E . TPD  prevents PDH E  degradation by preventing PDK  phos  phorylation of PDH E    and   serine sites. Proposed model of the mechanisms of TPD  in regulation of PDH E  in breast cancer cells and its effect on metformin response In this study  we have demonstrated that the TPD  interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and affects PDH protein and enzyme activity. Deletion of TPD  facil  itates the phosphorylation of PDH E  by PDK  resulting in increased phosphorylation of PDH E  at S  and S  and further ubiquitination and protein degradation of PDH E   Fig.  b . This degradation can be prevented by PDK  knockdown  Fig.  c . This newly discovered Zhuang et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   function of TPD  in the regulation of PDH further em  phasizes the importance to have enhanced activity of PDH and oxidative phosphorylation in order for metformin to induce ROS production and cell death. The loss of TPD  leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production  which contributes to reduced metformin cytotoxicity  Fig.  a  b . However  this can be reversed by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase by knocking down PDK   Fig.  b  c .  chunk section section heading Discussion  heading chunk Previously identified proteins that interact with TPD  include TPD    MAL proteolipid family  MAL    and phosphatase of regenerating liver  PRL  using a yeast two hybrid system  . The interaction with TPD  and MAL  potentially implicates TPD s role in cell proliferation and vesicle transport  respectively. The PRL  binding proteins identified by Lee et al. included TPD  NDUFB   NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B  and FKBP . NDUFB  and FKBP  are known to have mitochondrial localizations  . Now  we have shown that TPD  also has a mitochondrial dis  tribution and interacts with PDH E  in breast cancer cells  indicating its potentially important role in the metabolic regulation in cancer. Pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  is a key rate limiting enzyme that determines the metabolic balance between glycolysis versus mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  . It can be phosphorylated and inactivated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases  PDKs . This leads to the inhib  ition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced aerobic glycolysis  a hallmark of metabolic reprogramming for tumor growth and resistance to therapy  . Our data demonstrates that the protein interaction between TPD  and PDH E  affects PDH E  protein stability and cell metabolism. TPD  knockdown reduces PDH E  protein and alters cellular metabolism by decreasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increasing aerobic glycolysis. PDH E  degradation in TPD  knockdown cells could be partially restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG . This indicates that TPD  plays an important role in regulating PDH E  protein stability. Once the enzyme activity of PDH E   is enhanced in TPD  knockdown cells by knockdown of upstream inhibitory kinases  PDK  or using PDK in  hibitor such as DCA  despite reduced PDH E  protein level  cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment can be restored to levels similar to that of control cells. These data collectively reveal a new function of TPD  in al  tering cellular metabolism and response to metformin by regulating PDH E . Metformin induced cell death was Fig.   Proposed model of the mechanisms of TPD  in regulation of PDH E  in breast cancer cells and its effect on metformin response. TPD  interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and affects PDH protein and enzyme activity. Loss of TPD  causes increased phosphorylation of PDH E  at S  by PDK  resulting in further ubiquitination and protein degradation of PDH E  and this phenotype can be restored by PDK  knockdown  b  c . Loss of TPD  leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production  which contribute to reduced metformin cytotoxicity  a  b . This can be reversed by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase by knocking down upstream inhibitory kinases PDK   b  c  Zhuang et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   totally abolished when CoCl   were added to mimic the hypoxic condition. This also emphasizes the importance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in determining cellular response to metformin  which provides valuable information for better individualizing metformin treat  ment. TPD  knockdown reduced PDH activity and oxygen consumption  this is similar to the effects of CoCl   and hypoxia. This could be an important factor to consider when treating tumors in vivo with metformin where some tumors are likely to have hypoxic microenviron  ment. Reducing hypoxia might be a reasonable strategy to enhance metformin cytotoxicity for cancer treatment in vivo. The effects of TPD  on metformin sensitivity were also observed with the other two complex I inhibitors  piericidin A and rotenone  which suggested an import  ant role of TPD  in regulating mitochondrial complex I function. Therefore  the complex I OCR was measured with complex I specific substrates in control and TPD  knocked down cells with or without metformin. Metformin inhibited complex I in both control and TPD  knocked down cells  Additional file   Figure S B  C . The inhibitory effect of TPD  knockdown on complex I OCR was seen for all substrates except the high concentration of pyruvate   mM   Additional file   Figure S B   C . This could be due to the fact that pyruvate induced reactivation of PDH in TPD  knocked down cells. The inhibition of complex I was anticipated to affect NAD NADH ratio  . Our results demonstrated a significant reduction in NAD  NAD NADH ratio  and NADH accumulation after metfor  min treatment in both control and TPD  knocked down cells  Additional file   Figure S D F . The reduction of NAD level by metformin was more prominent in control cells than in shTPD  stable cells. As shown in Fig.  e  f and Fig.  a  a significantly higher ROS was produced in control cells upon metformin treatment. The activation of PARP by ROS induced DNA damage could contribute to a more rapid depletion of NAD  in control cells than in shTPD  cells  Additional file   Figure S D . The addition of NAD  or nicotinamide as extraneous resource of NAD  could prevent the cell death induced by metformin in both control and shTPD  cells  Additional file   Figure S G and H . Future studies will be necessary to further elucidate how TPD  might regulate mitochondrial function and  in turn  respond to complex I inhibitors. Current understanding of PDH E  protein stability is derived from studying the disease pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH complex deficiency  an inborn error of metabolism that most commonly occurs due to mutations in the E  subunit gene  PDHA . To date  more than   mutations of the PDH complex have been identified. Several studies have demonstrated that certain mutations within the PDHA  gene  E  subunit  can result in decreased protein stability  reduced protein levels  and PDH enzyme activity. Besides genetic mutations  Han et al.   have demonstrated that the EGFR PTK mediated tyro  sine phosphorylation of the E  protein leads to post translational modifications involving increased ubi  quitination and proteasome mediated degradation of the PDH E  subunit. Here  we have demonstrated in breast cancer cells that PDH E  protein levels are reg  ulated by TPD  protein through its interaction with PDH E  blocking upstream kinases  PDKs  and phos  phorylating specific sites on PDH E  including   and possibly   resulting in increased ubiquitination and protein degradation. This finding could enhance our understanding of patients with specific symptoms re  lated to PDH complex deficiency but who lack known genetic mutations. There are four pyruvate dehydrogenases including PDK  PDK  PDK  and PDK  all of which can phos  phorylate PDH E  with different specificities  . The four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases  PDK  PDK  PDK  and PDK  have varied catalytic activity toward PDH E . PDK  possesses the greatest activity to phosphorylate PDH E  at serine   the major site known to influence en  zyme activity  followed by PDK  PDK  and PDK . PDK  phosphorylates PDH E  at serine   with higher affinity than PDK    and  . PDK  is the only kinase known to phosphorylate PDH E  at serine   but its mechanism of PDH E  enzyme inactivation is not well understood. In our study  we demonstrate that TPD  is important in regulating PDH E  protein stability by preventing PDH E  phosphorylation at serine   and serine   by PDK   Fig.  . Therefore  in addition to its known mechanism of regulating enzyme activity by post translational modifica  tion  in this case  phosphorylation also contributes signifi  cantly to PDH E  function by increasing PDH E  ubiquitination and degradation. During this process  TPD  plays a major role by blocking access of upstream kinases and preventing phosphorylation of PDH E  affecting PDH E  stability in breast cancer cells. Obvi  ously  we cannot exclude the possibility that other potential modifications beyond phosphorylation might also contribute to this process. It has been suggested that TPD  is a tumor related protein. Based on our results  TPD  stabilizes PDH E  and its overexpression in breast cancer cells might be a compensatory feedback mechanism to maintain the status of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Studies are limited with regard to the biological function of TPD  in cancer cells  especially in breast cancer. In oral squamous cell carcinoma cells  TPD  was reported to be a negative regulator of tumor progression by downregulat  ing anchorage independent cell growth and migration in vitro and by attenuating tumor growth in vivo  . Our data demonstrate that  in breast cancer cells  downregula  tion of TPD  can reduce cellular oxygen consumption  increase colony formation  and decrease cancer cell Zhuang et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   sensitivity to metformin treatment. Overexpression of TPD  inhibits colony formation and enhances metfor  min cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells. These findings sug  gest that TPD  acts as a negative regulator of cell growth in breast cancer as observed in oral squamous carcinoma cells. We understand that even though our in vitro finding indicated TPD  as a tumor suppressor  however  its regu  lation on PDH and cancer metabolism might have differ  ent effects on tumorigenesis and cancer proliferation or metastasis in vivo. It has been shown that in vivo  cancer cells show more oxidative phosphorylation than those same cells in culture and that oxidative phosphorylation is advantageous for growth and metastasis in vivo    . This necessitates future in vivo experiments to be per  formed in order to further define the function of TPD  in breast cancer and its role in drug treatment response.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk TPD  has important biological functions in breast can  cer. It reduces breast cancer proliferation and enhances cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment in breast cancer cell lines and in breast cancer patient derived xeno  grafts by modulating the PDH enzyme activity in vitro. It prevents PDK mediated phosphorylation of PDHE  at serine   and S  and  therefore  reduces PDH E  ubiquitination and protein degradation. On the other hand  TPD  downregulation increases PDH E  protein deg  radation and leads to decreased PDH enzyme activity  which reduces mitochondrial oxygen consumption and re  active oxygen species  ROS  production  thus contributing to the resistance of breast cancer cells to metformin treat  ment. These findings provide new insights into under  standing the role of TPD  in the regulation of PDH complex  cancer metabolic reprogramming  and the mech  anisms of metformin resistance in breast cancer with low TPD  expression. These further highlight its potential ap  plication as a biomarker for selecting tumors that may be sensitive to metformin treatment.

In our previous pharmacogenomic studies using lymphoblastoid cell line  LCL  this protein has been identified to affect metformin response. Although metformin has been widely studied as a prophylactic and chemotherapeutic drug  there is still a lack of biomarkers predicting the response to metformin in breast cancer. In this study  we revealed the novel function of TPD  in breast cancer through understanding how TPD  altered the cancer cell sensitivity to metformin. Methods  The role of TPD  in altering cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment was carried out by either knockdown or overexpression of TPD  followed by measuring cell viability and reactive oxygen species  ROS  production in MCF  breast cancer cell line and breast cancer patient derived xenografts. Functional analysis of TPD  in breast cancer cells was demonstrated by studying TPD  protein localization and identification of potential binding partners of TPD  through immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The effect of TPD  on pyruvate dehydrogenase  PDH  protein regulation was demonstrated by western blot  immunoprecipitation  and site directed mutagenesis. Results  TPD  inhibited colony formation and enhanced cellular sensitivity to metformin treatment in MCF  cells and breast cancer patient derived xenografts. Mechanistic study indicated that TPD  had mitochondrial localization  bound to and stabilized pyruvate dehydrogenase E  by blocking pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase    PDK mediated serine   phosphorylation. TPD  knockdown increased PDH E  protein degradation and led to decreased PDH enzyme activity  which reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species  ROS  production  thus contributing to the resistance of breast cancer cells to metformin treatment. Conclusion  We have discovered a novel mechanism by which TPD  regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and affects the sensitivity of breast cancer to metformin treatment. Our findings highlight the important post translational regulation of PDK  on PDH E  and the potential application of TPD  as a biomarker for selecting tumors that may be sensitive to metformin therapy. These provide new insights into understanding the regulation of PDH complexes and the resistance mechanisms of cancer cells to metformin treatment. ,748,15.745989304812834

However  metabolic differences between isogenic cells with and without HSulf  have not been characterized upon HSulf  suppression in vitro. Since growth factor signaling is closely tied to metabolic alterations  we determined the extent to which HSulf  loss affects cancer cell metabolism. Results  Ingenuity pathway analysis of gene expression in HSulf  shRNA silenced cells  Sh  and Sh  cells  compared to non targeted control shRNA cells  NTC cells  and subsequent Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics  KEGG  database analysis showed altered metabolic pathways with changes in the lipid metabolism as one of the major pathways altered inSh  and   cells. Untargeted global metabolomic profiling in these isogenic cell lines identified approximately   metabolites using GC MS and LC MS MS platforms. Knockdown of HSulf  in OV  cells induced significant changes in   metabolites associated with several metabolic pathways including amino acid  lipids  and nucleotides. Loss of HSulf  promoted overall fatty acid synthesis leading to enhance the metabolite levels of long chain  branched  and essential fatty acids along with sphingolipids. Furthermore  HSulf  loss induced the expression of lipogenic genes including FASN  SREBF  PPAR  and PLA G  stimulated lipid droplet accumulation. Conversely  re expression of HSulf  in Sh  cells reduced the lipid droplet formation. Additionally  HSulf  also enhanced CPT A and fatty acid oxidation and augmented the protein expression of key lipolytic enzymes such as MAGL  DAGLA  HSL  and ASCL . Overall  these findings suggest that loss of HSulf  by concomitantly enhancing fatty acid synthesis and oxidation confers a lipogenic phenotype leading to the metabolic alterations associated with the progression of ovarian cancer. Conclusions  Taken together  these findings demonstrate that loss of HSulf  potentially contributes to the metabolic alterations associated with the progression of ovarian pathogenesis  specifically impacting the lipogenic phenotype of ovarian cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted.

The Warburg effect is one of the most important meta  bolic alteration in cancer  in which neoplastic cells exhibit higher glucose uptake and utilization by altering glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen to produce lac  tate from glucose and thereby decouples glycolysis from mitochondrial oxidation  . Although alterations in fatty acids  FAs  and lipid metabolism have received less attention  recently  their importance in cancer metabolism is being increasingly recognized. The total lipid pools re  quired for membrane synthesis of dividing cells are derived mainly from FAs and in part from acetyl CoA  . Cancer cells meet their FAs demand mainly by increasing de novo FA synthesis rather than from exogenous sources and partly from acetyl CoA  . The activated FAs can then be utilized in the synthesis of membrane phospholipids  PLs  including phosphatidylcholine  PC  phosphatidylethanol  amine  PE  in addition to sterols  sphingolipids  and lysoli  pids to meet the energy demands and proliferation. The rest of the activated FAs then function as signaling mole  cules or esterified as triglycerols or sterol esters and stored in lipid droplets  LDs   . Accumulating evidence suggest that activation of onco  genes such as MYC  NF kB  K RAS   and loss of tumor suppressor genes  P  LKB AMPK    forms a basis for altered metabolism of cancer cells. The onco  genic activation of c MYC turns on the Ras Raf MAPK signaling pathway along with HIF  and PI K Akt mTOR axis which transcriptionally stimulate the expression of most glycolytic and glutaminolytic genes and subsequently activate lipid metabolism  . Similarly  loss of tumor suppressors forms the basis of the Warburg effect leading to carcinogenesis. For example  p  activates TIGAR to reduce the cellular accumulation of fructose   bispho  sphate  an allosteric activator of phosphofructo kinase  a critical control point in glycolysis leads to decreased gly  colysis  . Moreover  growth factor mediated phosphor  ylation of pyruvate kinase isoform    PKM    and mutations of genes in IDH    in the metabolic path  ways such as glycolysis and the TCA cycle respectively have been identified that support growth of the rapidly proliferating cells and survive metabolic stress  . Human Sulfatase    HSulf  an endosulfatase estab  lished as a putative tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer  has been shown to modulate the signaling of growth factors and cytokines in tumor microenvironment  . Our previ  ous work demonstrated that loss of HSulf  modulates heparin binding growth factors such as bFGF  VEGF  HGF  PDGF  and heparin binding EGF  HB EGF  signaling  which plays an important role in tumor progression  me  tastasis  and angiogenesis  . Moreover  serous tu  mors with moderate to high levels of HSulf  had better prognosis in terms of overall survival  implicating its crit  ical role in the progression of ovarian cancer  . Our more recent data demonstrated that HSulf  knockdown clones in the OV  ovarian cancer cell line  OV Sh  and Sh  cells  have significantly increased the ability to form anchorage independent colonies in vitro and en  hanced tumorigenicity in vivo  . Also  in breast cancer  HSulf  is negatively regulated by HIF  but positively by von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor gene  . These findings led us to hypothesize that HSulf  might play a unique role to alter tumor microenvironment rais  ing the possibility that its loss might alter the cellular me  tabolism and levels of the resulting metabolites as a downstream effect of altered growth factor signaling. In the current study  global changes in metabolism were investigated in HSulf  silenced OV  cells by microarray  metabolic data analysis  and Western blotting. Here  we for the first time report that loss of HSulf  promotes overall fatty acid synthesis and oxidation leading to a lipogenic phenotype to promote cancer growth in ovarian cancer.  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Cell culture OV  cell line was low passage primary line established at the Mayo Clinic  . OV NTC  Sh  Sh  and Cl   cells were cultured in   CO     air humidified atmosphere at  C with minimal essential medium supplemented with   fetal bovine serum and   g ml puromycin  with non  essential amino acids. All cell lines were tested using a PCR based assay and found to be free of Mycoplasma contamination.

Transfection with Fugene  Roche  was performed accord  ing to the manufacturer s instructions. Transducted cells were selected with   g ml puromycin. Rescue of HSulf  in Sh  cells pcDNA HSulf  plasmid was cloned as described previ  ously  . Since Sh  shRNA targeted the  UTR of HSulf  Roy et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content    we rescued the expression of HSulf  in this cell line with CMV driven WT expression construct and selected stable clone C  as previously described  . Vector only transfected cells served as controls. Microarray expression data analysis OV  NTC  Sh  and Sh  cells in triplicates were profiled using Illumina Human HT   .  Expression Beadchip array as previously described  . Microarray expression data were analyzed on the log  scale. Data quality was assessed via box and whisker plots along with residual and pair wise MVA plots before and after normalization  . All arrays were normalized together using fastlo  a non linear normalization similar to cyclic loess which runs in a fraction of the time  . Both supervised and un  supervised analyses were performed. Supervised analysis to determine differentially expressed genes was performed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays  SAM   .

Unsupervised clustering was performed using the one minus correlation metric with average linkage. Heat maps were generated for visualization. Pathway ana  lysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis  In  genuity Systems  www.ingenuity.com . Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry  LC MS  LC MS     The LC MS portion of the platform was based on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC and a Thermo Finnigan LTQ mass spec  trometer  which consisted of an electrospray ionization  ESI  source and linear ion trap  LIT  mass analyzer. The sample extract was split into   aliquots  dried  then recon  stituted in acidic or basic LC compatible solvents  each of which contained   or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion optimized conditions and the other using basic negative ion optimized conditions in two independent in  jections using separate dedicated columns. Extracts recon  stituted in acidic conditions were gradient eluted using water and methanol both containing  .  Formic acid  while the basic extracts  which also used water methanol  contained  .  mM ammonium bicarbonate. The MS ana  lysis alternated between MS and data dependent MS   scans using dynamic exclusion. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry  GC MS  The samples destined for GC MS analysis were re dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of   h prior to being derivatized under dried nitrogen using bistrimethyl  silyl triflouroacetamide  BSTFA . The GC column was   phenyldimethyl silicone and the temperature ramp is from  C to  C in a  min period. Samples were analyzed by a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ fast scanning single  quadrupole mass spectrometer using electron impact ionization. The instrument was tuned and calibrated for mass resolution and mass accuracy on a daily basis. The information output from the raw data files was automatic  ally extracted as discussed below. Data extraction and compound identification Peaks were identified using Metabolon s proprietary peak integration software. Compounds were identified by com  parison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. Identification of known chemical en  tities was based on comparison to metabolomic library en  tries of purified standards. As of this writing  more than   commercially available purified standard com  pounds had been identified and registered into LIMS for distribution to both the LC and GC platforms for deter  mination of their analytical characteristics. The combin  ation of chromatographic properties and mass spectra gave an indication of a match to the specific compound or an isobaric entity. Metabolon data analysts use proprietary visualization and interpretation software to confirm the consistency of peak identification among the various sam  ples. Library matches for each compound were checked for each sample and corrected if necessary. Normalization Raw data from each sample was normalized to protein concentration as measured by Bradford assay prior to statistical analysis. Sample accessioning Each sample received was accessioned into the Metabolon LIMS system and was assigned by the LIMS  a unique identifier  which was associated with the original source identifier only. This identifier was used to track all sample handling  tasks  and results. The samples  and all derived aliquots  were bar coded and tracked by the LIMS system. All portions of any sample were automatically assigned their own unique identifiers by the LIMS when a new task was created  the relationship of these samples was also tracked. All samples were maintained at  C until processed. Sample preparation The sample preparation process was carried out using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company  Reno  NV  USA . Recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes. Sample preparation was conducted using a proprietary series of organic and aqueous extractions to remove the protein fraction while allowing maximum re  covery of small molecules. The resulting extract was Roy et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  divided into four fractions  two for analysis by LC and one for analysis by GC and a forth as a spare. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap  Zymark  Hopkinton  MA  USA  to remove the organic solvent. Each sample was then frozen and dried under vacuum. Samples were then pre  pared for the appropriate instrument  either LC MS or GC  MS. QA QC For QA QC purposes  a number of additional samples are included with each day s analysis. Furthermore  a selection of QC compounds is added to every sample  including those under test. These compounds are carefully chosen so as not to interfere with the measurement of the en  dogenous compounds. These QC samples are primarily used to evaluate the process control for each study as well as aiding in the data curation. Metaboanalyst Differently expressed metabolites between Sh Sh  and baseline conditions were firstly mapped to KEGG me  tabolites IDs according to Human Metabolome Database  HMDB  URL  http www.hmdb.ca   . Then  pathway analysis was performed to highlight relevant metabolic pathways defined in KEGG database  http www.genome. jp kegg  using an on line tool named MetaboAnalyst  http www.metaboanalyst.ca   . Specifically  two types of pathway analysis were done  one is over  representation analysis using hypergeometric test   asking if differentially expressed metabolites are par  ticularly enriched in a same pathway  the other is path  way topology analysis summarizing relative betweeness centrality   investigating potential pathway impact of observed metabolite changes based on known path  way topology relationships.

Fatty acid synthesis Cells were washed twice in cold PBS and resuspend in lysis buffer   mM Tris HCl  pH  .    mM EDTA    mM NaCl and PMSF. Cells were sonicated and homoge  nized by dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at   rpm for   min at  C. The supernatant was col  lected and proteins were measured by Bradford assay  and   g of protein was used to conduct FASN activity assay. FASN activity was measured by protocol described by Vazquez Martin et al.  . Briefly    g of protein was incubated with   M NADPH    M acetyl CoA and   M malonyl CoA in assay buffer   mM potas  sium phosphate  pH  .    mM DTT    mM EDTA  and oxidation of NADPH was measured by monitoring the ab  sorbance at   nM over the period of the time. Results presented here compares FASN activity monitored for   min. Values are presented as nanomolar NADPH oxidized per minute per milligram of protein.

Consistent with these observa  tions  our growth assays showed enhanced growth rate in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC cells  Additional file   Figure S . Here  to elucidate the function of puta  tive tumor suppressor HSulf  in the metabolism of ovar  ian cancer  we performed gene expression profiling of stably knockdown HSulf  clonal lines OV  Sh  and Sh  cells  referred to from hereon as Sh  and Sh  com  pared to HSulf  expressing non targeted control cells  OV NTC  referred to as NTC    in triplicates using Illumina HumanHT   v  platform  . Unbiased hier  archical clustering and heat maps showed that genes in several different pathways were differentially expressed in Sh  and Sh  compared to NTC cells  Figure  A . We found that over   and   genes were differentially expressed in Sh  and Sh  cells  respectively  compared to NTC at  .  FC  p and FDR  lt . . We identified   and   altered genes in Sh  and Sh  cells respectively by significance analysis of microarrays  SAM    from the comprehensive list of   genes which encoded all known human metabolic enzymes and transporters re  ported by Possemato et al.  . Ingenuity pathway analysis  http www.ingenuity.com  for these genes showed that most genes were differentially regulated in the fatty acid lipid pathways in Sh  and Sh  cells com  pared to NTC cells  Additional file   Table S  Figure  B . We next explored the   genes in the lipid related pathways from our microarray data by unsupervised clus  tering  Figure  C  and found that     of   genes were differentially expressed in Sh  and Sh  cells com  pared to NTC cells  Figure  D  indicating that tumor sup  pressor HSulf  possibly regulates the lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer cells. Loss of HSulf  altered global metabolic profile in ovarian cancer cells To determine whether loss of HSulf  has effect in cellu  lar metabolism  we performed unbiased global metabolic profiling using the Metabolon platform  Metabolon Inc  Durham  NC  USA  in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC. The samples were extracted using Metabolons standard solvent extraction method from cells in loga  rithmic phase with   biological replicates for each sam  ple and distributed into equal parts for analysis on the GC MS and LC MS MS platforms. Hierarchical cluster  ing revealed that metabolite levels of Sh  and Sh  cells cluster together separately from control NTC  Figure  A . Our initial principal component analysis  PCA    re  vealed that Sh  and Sh  cells had specific group of metab  olites which were different from NTC cells  Figure  B . Additionally  t test in each principal component dimen  sion showed that PCA differences between Sh Sh  and NTC cells mainly reside in the first and second principal components  with statistically significant p values of  . e   and  . e   respectively. Consistent with this  two  dimensional PCA plots showed differences between Sh  Sh  and NTC are mainly in the first and second PC di  mensions  Figure  C D E . We also performed linear re  gression analysis to evaluate association of each principal component vs. major metabolite classes  to determine if lipid class is one of the dominant factors determining the first and second principal components. The associ  ation was evaluated in a multivariate regression model  Additional file   Figure S  where coefficients of first  second PCs were treated as dependent variable  and metabolite class labels were regarded as independent variables. This analysis showed that the lipid class has statistically significant association with both first and second PC dimensions  with p values    . e   and  . e   respectively. Interestingly  the peptide class  despite its relatively small size  also has significant asso  ciations with both first and second PC dimensions  while the amino acid class has significant association with the first principal component. Moreover  this analysis showed a total of   known metabolites altered by the loss of HSulf  in Sh  and Sh  cells.

However  some metabolites were differentially altered in the Sh  and Sh  cells. The differentially changed metabo  lites between these ShRNAs could also be a function of the level of knockdown and where the ShRNAs could have in  tegrated. The extent of knockdown in Sh  targeting the  UTR was close to  . However  with Sh  RNA target  ing the open reading frame  there was still some level of HSulf  present  Figure  A   . Alteration of lipid metabolites upon HSulf  loss The lipogenic phenotype characterized by the activation of lipid metabolism is recognized as a universal feature of most cancers  . Apart from the fatty acid  FA  uptake  cancer cells requires de novo FA biosynthesis to synthesize new membranes  to store energy in lipid droplets and to form the lipidic platform for signaling in membrane level in lipid rafts for increased signaling of cell growth receptors  . Moreover  circulating lipids also play a significant role in cancer cell growth  migration  and invasion  . Of the   common metabolites altered in Sh  and Sh  cells      me  tabolites belonged to the lipid class including long  chain FAs  lysolipids  sphingolipids  glycerolipids  ei  cosanoids  and carnitine  Additional file   Table S  in which   metabolites were upregulated  . Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics  KEGG  database  we mapped these metabolites to major pathways impacted with alterations in the key junctions  . These included linoleic acid  glycerophospholipid  arachi  donic acid  Additional file   Figure S  and sphingolipid pathways  . Consistent with these data  we found that among the   long chain fatty acid metabolites de  tected    metabolites were significantly increased by   fold including palmitate  stearate  and oleate  while the remaining   long chain FAs did not show any significant differences in both Sh  and Sh  cells  Figure  A . Of note  docosadienoate  n   nonadeconoate and eicoseno  ate  n  levels were increased approximately sevenfold compared to NTC. Additionally  all the detected branched fatty acid metabolites were augmented  Figure  B  while five of six essential fatty acids detected were increased  . fold  Figure  C . The key structural lipids in cell membranes are the glycerol phospholipids including phosphatidyl choline  phosphatidyl ethanolamine  phosphatidyl serine  phos  phatidyl inositol  and phosphatidic acid in addition to other lipids  such as sterols  sphingolipids  and lyso  phospholipids. Sphingolipids such as ceramide  sphingo  sine  and sphingosine phosphate are bioactive lipids which can dictate the signaling including growth factor responses  inflammation  apoptosis  and proliferation  . Our metabolite analysis revealed that HSulf  deficiency was closely associated with increased levels of sphinganine  FC    .  p    lt .  sphingosine  FC    .  p    lt .  palmitoyl sphingomyelin  FC    .  p    lt .  and FC    .  p    lt .  and stearoyl sphingomyelin  FC    .  p    lt .  and FC    .  p    lt .   Figure  D . Additionally  we found that knockdown of HSulf  expression also largely affected the metabolite levels of choline inositol pathway  Figure  E  and lysophospholipids  Figure  F  including reduced glycerophosphorylcholine  GPC   FC    .  p    .  in Sh  cells only  and glycerol  phosphate  G P   FC    .  p    .  and FC    .  p    lt . . Altogether  these results implicated a key role of HSulf  in increased lipid metabolism and signaling. Deficiency of HSulf  in ovarian cancer induced higher expression of lipogenic genes All the lipid molecules in cells are derived in part from acetyl CoA  and many contain FAs. These FA building blocks come from either exogenous sources or from de novo FA synthesis. Thus  malignant cells synthesize their own FA de novo and thereby exhibit a preference over exogenous FA uptake  while most normal human cells prefer exogenous sources  . Our microarray analysis showed that mRNA levels of lipogenic en  zymes fatty acid synthase  FASN  sphingosine kinase    SPHK  PLA G A  PLA G  sterol regulatory element  binding transcription factor    SREBF  and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  PPAR  are also upregu  lated upon loss of HSulf   Figure  A . Consistent with the increased levels of these genes and lipid metabolites  qRT PCR and immunoblotting showed enhanced mRNA  Figure  B  and protein  Figure  C  expressions of FASN  SPHK  PLA G A  PLA G  SREBF  and PPAR in the Sh  and Sh  cells compared to the NTC cells. The in  crease in the mRNA and protein expression of FASN along with the increased production of several long chain FAs in Sh  and Sh  cells indicated that fatty acid synthesis was enhanced in HSulf  silenced cells. To confirm  we also measured the enzymatic activity of FASN and found almost twofold higher activity of FASN in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC cells  Figure  D . These data sug  gest that loss of HSulf  can increase the activity of FASN to enhance FA synthesis. Roy et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  Figure    See legend on next page.  Roy et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  Interestingly  FASN  SPHK  PLA G A  PLA G  SRE BF  and PPAR are the key enzymes which are localized and involved in the biogenesis of lipid droplets  LD   . The FAs are activated by covalent modification by CoA via fatty acyl CoA synthetases and esterified to gly  cerol generating triglycerides or sterol esters that are stored in lipid droplets  . Accumulation of cytoplasmic LDs forms a basis of increased growth and chemoresistance in neoplastic cells  . To explore whether increased ex  pression of above enzymes resulted in LD formation  we imaged the LDs by bodipy staining which clearly showed increased LDs in Sh  and Sh  cells. As expected  there were very few LDs in the NTC cells  Figure  E .

Bodipy staining revealed that rescue of HSulf  significantly reduced the number of lipid droplets in Sh   Sh  clone   compared to Sh  vector control with many LDs  Figure  G  demonstrating that loss of HSulf  promotes LD biogenesis.

Moreover  increased levels of oleolycarnitine were  .  and  . fold in Sh  and Sh  respectively  Figure  A . Carnitine is important for shuttling FAs across mitochon  drial membranes for oxidation and so the escalation of carnitine level enhances  oxidation support the increased growth of ovarian cancer. To determine if  oxidation was enhanced in Sh  and Sh  cells  we measured the mRNA and protein level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase    CPT A  and the results showed a higher level of CPT A in both in Sh  and Sh  cells  Figure  B . The increase in the expression of CPT A mRNA along with increased production of several of the long chain FAs in Sh  and Sh  cells indicated that these cells may utilize long chain FAs by  oxidation to generate more ATP to accommo  date increase proliferation. Next  to confirm this notion  we determined the fatty acid oxidation  FAO  and results showed that FAO was higher both in Sh  and Sh  com  pared to NTC cells upon addition of palmitate  Figure  C . Subsequently  we demonstrated that Etomoxir  a spe  cific inhibitor of CPT A  decreased FAO more sig  nificantly in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC cells. We also demonstrated that Sh  and Sh  cells were more sensitive toward Etomoxir treatment than NTC confirming a major role of FAO in their survival  Additional file   Figure S . Since FAs are stored in lipid droplets and released by the action of lipolytic enzymes  we determined the expres  sion of monoacylglycerol lipase  MAGL  diacylglycerol lipase alpha  DAGLA  long chain acyl CoA synthetase  ACSL  and hormone sensitive lipase  HSL . Immuno  blot analysis showed that the expression of these enzymes was upregulated in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC cells  Figure  D  demonstrating that loss of HSulf  acti  vates beta oxidation and lipolysis. Altered metabolism in amino acid and peptide super pathways in cells with loss of HSulf  In addition to the altered lipid metabolism  the metabolo  mic analysis revealed that amino acids and their deriva  tives were the second most class of metabolites altered in HSulf  knockdown cells  Additional file   Table S .

We also observed alterations of N acetylated amino acids including N acetyl alanine  serine  and threonine resulted from the action of N acetyltransferases on acetyl CoA and L amino acids where all the six N acetylated amino acid tested were downregulated. The amino acid  derived antioxidant  both reduced and oxidized gluta  thione levels were lower in HSulf deficient cells.

Multiple signaling pathways and several molecules are involved in the synthesis and deg  radation of the lipids and also the activities of lipid me  tabolizing enzymes are regulated by a complex interplay between metabolic  tumor suppressor  and oncogenic signaling  . Though loss of HSulf  a putative tumor suppressor gene  was well known to promote tumorigen  esis  angiogenesis   and invasion   in breast   and ovarian   cancers  the role of HSulf  was never elucidated in altered metabolism of ovarian cancer cells so far. Thus  in the present study  we have shown that loss of the putative tumor suppressor  HSulf    promotes altered metabolic pathways including lipid  amino acid  and nucleotide. Of the several pathways al  tered by loss of HSulf  the lipid and amino acid pathway related metabolites accounted for   of the total altered metabolites identified. In ovarian cancer  al  tered lipid metabolism was detected in patients during early and late stages of disease compared to healthy con  trols  . In contrast to lipid pathway related metabo  lites  there are very few reports on the alteration in the amino acid levels in OVCa. We found a significant down  regulation of most of the amino acids with loss of HSulf  consistent with Zhang et al. s report where they showed Roy et al.

This down  regulation could be due to differences in uptake from the media  increased utilization  and or catabolism since in  creased demand for utilization of amino acids has been re  ported in other cancers  . Other studies have shown an increase in amino acid levels in the serum of patients with colon and breast cancers  . While the majority of amino acids were downregulated  we found significant upregulation of cysteine and its derivatives hypotaurine and taurine in Sh  and Sh  cells. Significant upregulation in cysteine  taurine  and hypotaurine could be the result of increased levels of cysteine dioxygenase type I  CDO    in Sh  and Sh  cells  data not shown . While tau  rine is reported to be downregulated in cancer   it is also reported to be increased in tumors of the prostate  squamous cell carcinoma and liver metastasis  . Additionally  levels of myo inositol and taurine concentra  tions both in vivo and in vitro are correlated with cell density of the tumors  . Additionally  we also saw an increase in the dipeptide pro hydroxy pro in Sh  and Sh  cells. Increase in pro  hydroxy proline is consistent with the report that major cartilage ECM proteins type II collagen and aggrecan were significantly lower in HSulf   chondrocytes sug  gesting that loss of HSulf  may regulate the overall bal  ance of cartilage matrix synthesis and degradation  . Consistent with this  significant alterations in several UDP glycosylation moieties  including UDP acetylglu  cosamine UDP acetylgalactosamine UDP glucose  UDP  glucuronate  and UDP galactose are also supportive of changes in extracellular matrix remodeling with reduced HSulf  expression. The major pathway identified by both ingenuity pathway analysis and metabolic profiling was the alterations in the lipid pathway. Lipids are as important building blocks as carbohydrates to form the basic skeleton of rapidly dividing cells  and therefore  large amounts of FAs are required to accommodate high rates of proliferation in cancer cells  . Additionally  the source of FAs may determine the phospholipid composition of membranes. Moreover  it was reported that in high grade ovarian cancer  long chain fatty acids were elevated  . Our results indicate that with the loss of HSulf  there was a significant increase in the long chain FAs along with branched and essential FAs in ovarian cancer. These high levels of FAs in ovar  ian cancer with the absence of HSulf  indicate a major role of HSulf  in FA synthesis. This enhanced produc  tion of FAs might meet the structural needs of highly proliferative ovarian cancer cells  requirement  when the tumor suppressor HSulf  is lost. Sphingolipids and lysolipid or lysophospholipids are bioactive lipid molecules which play pivotal role in can  cer pathogenesis. The most important sphingolipids are ceramide and sphingosine phosphate and the balance between these two define the cell s fate. In cancer  sphingolipid metabolism is altered and includes changes in the levels of sphingolipids and the enzymes involved in their metabolism  . Lysolipids with their various FA side chains are also bioactive lipids which mainly function as growth stimulating factor and induce cell proliferation  differentiation  and cell migration  . Herein  we report an increase in sphingolipids including sphinganine  sphingosine  palmitoylsphingomyelin along with altered choline inositol and lysolipid content. Interest  ingly  according to the KEGG database  metabolite mapping and glycerophospholipid  arachidonic  and sphingolipid metabolisms were identified as key junctions. These re  sults clearly indicate that with the loss of HSulf  the cell remodeled its own lipid synthesis in a manner to supply both structural and signaling lipids to malignant cells. In cancer cells  the increased lipid synthesis is due to the higher expression and activity of lipogenic enzymes  . Changes in the expression and activity of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are regulated by metabolic and oncogenic signalling pathways  . We identified enhanced expression of FASN  SREBF  SPHK  and PPAR related to lipid biogenesis. Upregulation of these key lipogenic enzymes with the loss of HSulf  were further corroborated by their mRNA and protein ex  pressions. Moreover higher enzymatic activity of FASN strongly supports the enhanced biogenesis of FAs with HSulf  loss. Additionally  phospholipase related genes PLA G  PLA G A  PNPLA  PLA G C  and PNPLA  involved in lipolysis were also found to be higher in Sh  and Sh . Interestingly  PLA G  is an important enzyme in lipid metabolism and implicated in LD biogenesis  . Recently  it was reported that cancer cells contain in  creased numbers of lipid droplets compared with normal tissue   which are storage sites for triglycerides and cholesterol to be used as energy source. Loss of HSulf  induced an increase in PLA G  expression that may lead to the accumulation of LD in ovarian cancer. Furthermore  reduction in the number of LDs with the rescue of HSulf    expression in Sh  cells establishes a direct connection to the loss of a putative tumor suppressor HSulf  and en  hanced LD biogenesis in ovarian cancer. In accordance with these results  we also demonstrated lower level of carnitine along with higher level of carni  tine derivatives suggestive of enhanced transport of FAs through the mitochondrial membrane. More import  antly  the augmented CPT A level in Sh  and Sh  cells strongly support the possibility of enhanced  oxidation. Increased and altered FA synthesis in cancer is a well  accepted phenomenon  however  enhanced expression and activity of lipolytic enzymes in tumor cells is a recent ob  servation. In prostate cancer  malignant cells solely rely on FAO as their energy resource  . Here  we report that Roy et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  loss of HSulf  also promotes enhanced FAO in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC. Consistent with increased lipolysis  our results indicated a significant increase in the expression of important lipolytic enzymes including MAGL  DAGLA  HSL  and ASCL  in Sh  and Sh  cells compared to NTC cells. Higher MAGL expression has been shown to stimulate pro tumorigenic signals and pro  motes survival  tumor growth  and migration  . In this regard  the relationship between synthesis  storage  and utilization of free fatty acids  FFA  through beta oxidation for energy production is very poorly understood. While the prevailing belief that cells that have increased FA syn  thesis usually do not undergo beta oxidation  it has also been suggested that newly synthesized FFA are immedi  ately converted into neutral lipids and stored in lipid drop  lets  . The FFAs are released by the action of lipases such as mono acyl glycerol  MAGL  which is then used for new membrane synthesis  lipid signaling and beta oxi  dation for energy production for the anabolic reactions. Our data seems to support this hypothesis since the Sh  Sh  cells have both increased the rate of FA synthesis and beta oxidation compared to NTC cells. The FFA may be immediately converted to neutral lipids and stored in lipid droplets to be released under stress conditions. Increasing evidence indicates that metabolic alterations induced by loss of tumor suppressor genes are common in cancer  . These alterations are critical for growth and survival of cancer cells. This is the first comprehen  sive report on metabolic alterations induced by loss of HSulf  a putative tumor suppressor gene in ovarian and breast cancer. Our results clearly indicate that loss of HSulf  remodels lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer. It is well accepted that HSulf  is a major regulator of growth factor mediated signaling and altered the tumor micro  environment in ovarian cancer  however  how HSulf  dir  ectly reconstructs the lipid metabolism in terms of FA synthesis  lipolysis  and enhanced LD formation is yet to be unraveled. A better understanding of the function of HSulf  its role in energy metabolism  glycolysis  TCA cy  cles  PPP  and its regulation on target genes involved in al  tered cellular metabolism could lead to a better understanding of tumorigenesis as well as development of new targeted therapy. Conclusions HSulf  is reported to be an important tumor suppressor gene and its expression is lost in a majority of ovarian tu  mors. This study demonstrates a significant alteration of cellular metabolism upon loss of HSulf  in OV  cells. Microarray analysis and metabolite profiling is performed to ascertain the impact of HSulf  on the overall meta  bolic changes including alterations in lipid and amino acid pathways. The major finding from our study shows the metabolic reprogramming of cells toward an enhanced lipid metabolism upon absence of HSulf . Cells adopt a lipogenic phenotype which is manifested with an excess fatty acid synthesis and an upregulated beta oxidation. Furthermore  HSulf deficient cells accumulate a huge amount of cytoplasmic lipid droplets to accommodate the excessive fatty acid syntheses. The present findings are supported by the increasing evidences of enhanced lipid metabolism in cancer cells facilitating cell survival  prolif  eration  and signaling. Our results indicate that  loss of HSulf  is enabling the cells to synthesize more lipids to expedite the high proliferation rate and survival. Additional files Additional file   Figure S .

However  metabolic differences between isogenic cells with and without HSulf  have not been characterized upon HSulf  suppression in vitro. Since growth factor signaling is closely tied to metabolic alterations  we determined the extent to which HSulf  loss affects cancer cell metabolism. Results  Ingenuity pathway analysis of gene expression in HSulf  shRNA silenced cells  Sh  and Sh  cells  compared to non targeted control shRNA cells  NTC cells  and subsequent Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics  KEGG  database analysis showed altered metabolic pathways with changes in the lipid metabolism as one of the major pathways altered inSh  and   cells. Untargeted global metabolomic profiling in these isogenic cell lines identified approximately   metabolites using GC MS and LC MS MS platforms. Knockdown of HSulf  in OV  cells induced significant changes in   metabolites associated with several metabolic pathways including amino acid  lipids  and nucleotides. Loss of HSulf  promoted overall fatty acid synthesis leading to enhance the metabolite levels of long chain  branched  and essential fatty acids along with sphingolipids. Furthermore  HSulf  loss induced the expression of lipogenic genes including FASN  SREBF  PPAR  and PLA G  stimulated lipid droplet accumulation. Conversely  re expression of HSulf  in Sh  cells reduced the lipid droplet formation. Additionally  HSulf  also enhanced CPT A and fatty acid oxidation and augmented the protein expression of key lipolytic enzymes such as MAGL  DAGLA  HSL  and ASCL . Overall  these findings suggest that loss of HSulf  by concomitantly enhancing fatty acid synthesis and oxidation confers a lipogenic phenotype leading to the metabolic alterations associated with the progression of ovarian cancer. Conclusions  Taken together  these findings demonstrate that loss of HSulf  potentially contributes to the metabolic alterations associated with the progression of ovarian pathogenesis  specifically impacting the lipogenic phenotype of ovarian cancer cells that can be therapeutically targeted. ,805,15.932919254658385

May   Background Burn injury is a significant problem that affects approxi  mately half a million people in the U.S. annually. One of the major complications emerging from burn injury is hyperglycemia  which can last for weeks following the initial trauma. Current therapeutic methods include tight euglycemic control and insulin treatment  which are asso  ciated with increases in hypoglycemia and mortality. High glucose levels decrease wound healing  while decreased glucose with insulin improves it. Alternatives to insulin therapy include biguanide drugs such as metformin. Met  formin downregulates gluconeogenesis  and reduces blood glucose levels by activating GLUT  in muscle cells. Recent work has also shown that metformin decreases keratino  cyte proliferation in vitro. As the burn wounds in our patients typically yield severe hypertrophic scars  which result from a hyperproliferation of fibroblasts  we have studied the effect of metformin on wound healing  proliferation  and epithelial mesenchymal transition  EMT . We hypothesize that biguanides will decrease EMT  thereby promoting a less fibrogenic state called MET  in fibroblasts derived from normal skin and burn skin and scar  resulting in decreased scarring. Here we examine the effects of metformin on cellular proliferation and EMT. Materials and methods Fibroblasts were isolated from skin and burn scar from pediatric burn patients  and non burned fibroblasts pur  chased from ATCC.

May    chunk section section heading Background  heading chunk The family of  phospofructo kinase fructose bis  phosphatases  PFKFB  control glycolytic flux via their product  fructose bisphosphate  F BP  which activates the key control step   phosphofructo kinase  PFK . We recently demonstrated that exposure of estrogen receptor  ER  MCF  human breast cancer cells to estradiol  E  causes a rapid increase in   C glucose uptake and glycolysis that is coincident with an induction of PFKFB  mRNA  via ER binding to its promoter  protein expression and the intracellular concentration of its product  F BP. Selective inhibition of PFKFB  expres  sion and activity using siRNA or a PFKFB  inhibitor  PFK  markedly reduced the E mediated increase in F BP    C glucose uptake and glycolysis. Importantly  co treatment of MCF  cells with PFK  and an ER antagonist synergistically induced apoptotic cell death in vitro. In the current study  we sought to determine if co administration of PFK  with ICI    fulvestrant  would have an additive anti tumor effect on ER  human breast cancer xenografts in vivo. Materials and methods Methods included apoptosis assays  measurements of  chunk section section chunk  C glucose uptake and glycolysis  and an E dependent ER  MCF  xenograft model of breast tumorigenesis.  Results Initially  we found that the inhibitory effects of PFK  on MCF  cell glycolysis but not glucose uptake lasted   hours after E  exposure suggesting that flux through PFK  and not the pentose shunt was the key metabolic target of PFK . We then confirmed that E  upregulated PFKFB  in a second ER  breast cancer cell line  T D cells  and found that PFK  also synergistically increased the apoptotic effects of ICI   in these cells. In order to determine if there exists potential clinical utility in com  bining PFKFB  and ER antagonists  we next implanted BALB c athymic mice with  beta E  pellets  dose  .  mg  days  and subcutaneously injected     MCF  cells in   l of matrigel. After   days  mice that devel  oped tumors  gt  mg were randomized into four treatment groups and administered DMSO  ICI   PFK  or the combination and tumor volumes were assessed every three days for   days using microcalipers. We found that the combination of ICI   with PFK  yielded the greatest anti tumor effect in this E dependent model of tumorigenesis  DMSO     .  mg  ICI      .  mg  PFK      mg  ICI     PFK      mg.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk These results provide essential pre clinical information that may allow for the design of combinatorial phase I II trials of PFKFB  antagonists with anti estrogen therapies in ER  stage IV breast cancer patients.

We recently demonstrated that exposure of estrogen receptor  ER  MCF  human breast cancer cells to estradiol  E  causes a rapid increase in   C glucose uptake and glycolysis that is coincident with an induction of PFKFB  mRNA  via ER binding to its promoter  protein expression and the intracellular concentration of its product  F BP.

Crawford   and Gary J. Patti    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Recent in vitro and in vivo work has shown that lactate provides an important source of carbon for metabolic reactions in cancer cell mitochondria. An interesting question is whether lactate is oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase  LDH  in the cytosol and or in mitochondria. Since metabolic processes in the cytosol and mitochondria are affected by redox balance  the location of LDH may have important regulatory implications in cancer metabolism. Methods  Within most mammalian cells  metabolic processes are physically separated by membrane bound compartments. Our general understanding of this spatial organization and its role in cellular function  however  suffers from the limited number of techniques to localize enzymatic activities within a cell. Here  we describe an approach to assess metabolic compartmentalization by monitoring the activity of pharmacological inhibitors that cannot be transported into specific cellular compartments. Results  Oxamate  which chemically resembles pyruvate  is transported into mitochondria and inhibits LDH activity in purified mitochondria. GSK A  in contrast  is a competitive inhibitor of NAD  which cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. GSK A did not inhibit the LDH activity of intact mitochondria  but GSK A did inhibit LDH activity after the inner mitochondrial membrane was disrupted. Conclusions  Our results are consistent with some mitochondrial LDH that is accessible to oxamate  but inaccessible to GSK A until mitochondria are homogenized. This strategy of using inhibitors with selective access to subcellular compartments  which we refer to as transport exclusion pharmacology  is broadly applicable to localize other metabolic reactions within cells. Keywords  Lactate  Lactate dehydrogenase  Transport exclusion pharmacology  Redox balance  chunk section section heading Background  heading chunk Most mammalian cells contain organelles that are bounded by lipid membranes. The chemical reactions occurring in each of these compartments are seques  tered from the rest of the cell  thereby providing an op  portunity to specialize metabolism in support of specific organelle functions. Some examples include generating harmful metabolic byproducts in organelles where they can be neutralized  such as hydrogen peroxide in peroxisomes  adjusting chemical concentrations to drive reactions in a direction that they may not proceed in other parts of the cell  such as using a proton gradient to fuel ATP synthesis in mitochondria  and harboring anabolic and catabolic reactions in different compart  ments to limit unproductive futile cycling  such as fatty acid synthesis in the cytosol and fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria     . Despite increasing evidence that metabolic compartmentalization is essential to various cellular func  tions  the spatial organization of metabolism within a cell re  mains poorly understood due to the technical challenges of measuring subcellular location.

Although organelles can be efficiently purified for metabolic evaluation  co purified contaminates are a consid  erable challenge  . Metabolite interactions with the outer membrane leaflet or its associated proteins  for example  can complicate data analysis. For mitochondria  which are the focus of the current work  the intermembrane space creates additional difficulties. Proteomic analyses suffer from the same problems  . High resolution microscopy can be applied to image proteins within a cell  but this does not re  flect protein activity. Functional assays from purified mito  chondria can be insightful  however  it is difficult to confirm that protein activity occurs within the mitochondrial matrix. Further  an incomplete understanding of mitochondrial carrier systems has limited our ability to study compartmentalization by manipulating metabolite transport  . Thus  strategies to localize metabolic transformations within subcellular compartments such as mitochondria are highly needed. In this work  we were specifically interested in localizing the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase  LDH  within cells. Re  cent studies have shown that some cancer cells use lactate in vitro and in vivo as a primary carbon source for meta  bolic pathways in mitochondria  such as the tricarboxylic acid  TCA  cycle  . LDH is required to incorporate lactate carbon into TCA cycle intermediates. An interest  ing question is whether this LDH activity occurs in the cytosol and or in mitochondria. When oxidizing lactate to pyruvate  LDH simultaneously reduces NAD   to NADH. Neither NAD   nor NADH can cross the inner mitochon  drial membrane  and the ratio of NAD   to NADH modu  lates numerous biological processes in both the cytosol and mitochondria. Thus  the location of LDH may select  ively influence redox balance within subcellular compart  ments and therefore have important regulatory implications in cancer metabolism  .  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Cell culture and drug treatments Unless otherwise noted  cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium  DMEM   .  g L D glucose   Life Technologies  contain  ing   Fetal Bovine Serum  FBS   Life Technologies  and   penicillin streptomycin  Life Technologies  at   C with   CO   .

The method  which we refer to as transport exclusion pharmacology  assumes that the activity of enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix is only affected by Niu et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   exogenously delivered inhibitors that cross the inner mito  chondrial membrane. When an inhibitor without access to the mitochondrial matrix does not affect enzymatic activity in whole cell analyses  this suggests that the enzyme is ex  clusively localized to the matrix  Fig.  . When whole cell experiments show reduced enzymatic activity  in contrast  it indicates that at least some enzyme has an extramito  chondrial location. To identify cases of redundancy where enzymes  e.g.  LDH  are located in both the mitochondrial matrix as well as other cellular locations with potentially differential access to inhibitors  the same experiment can be repeated on isolated mitochondria. When testing iso  lated mitochondria with inhibitors that do not have access to the matrix and enzyme activity is unaffected  this indi  cates enzyme localization to the matrix. All results can be validated by using homogenized mitochondria  which al  lows inhibitors to access matrix localized proteins inde  pendent of their transport properties. We applied this strategy to localize LDH in HeLa cells here because we already evaluated the spatial organization of LDH in these cells with other methods previously  . Functional LDH is a homo  or heterotetramer made up of LDHA and LDHB subunits  . We considered two compounds  oxamate and GSK A  known to in  hibit both LDHA and LDHB subunits at the concentra  tions we used  . We note that because our inhibition experiments are not specific to enzyme subtype  we cannot distinguish between LDHA and LDHB in the analyses. It has been shown previously  however  that LDHB is concentrated in HeLa cell mitochondria  . Oxamate is an isoelectric and isosteric analogue of pyru  vate  having a dissociation constant with LDH NADH that is close to the Michaelis Menten constant of pyruvate  . Additionally  oxamate is transported into mitochon  dria by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier  . GSK A  on the other hand  is a competitive in  hibitor of NAD  which cannot cross the inner mitochon  drial membrane  . When given to intact HeLa cells  both compounds inhibited LDH activity as measured by the amount of lactate excreted into the media  Fig.  . Consistent with previous reports  we found that micromo  lar concentrations of GSK A achieved the same level of LDH inhibition as millimolar concentrations of oxamate  . These results show that  as expected  LDH is not exclusively localized to HeLa cell mitochondria. We next wished to consider the possibility that LDH is present in both the cytosol and mitochondria  as has been suggested previously  . To evaluate mito  chondrial metabolism specifically  we purified intact mitochondria from HeLa cells and verified their integrity and metabolic function. We determined the respiratory control ratio  state  state   of purified HeLa cell mito  chondria to be  gt   . We also confirmed that our purified HeLa cell mitochondria responded to the addition of various substrates and inhibitors as expected  Add  itional files   and   Figures S  and S . After purifying intact mitochondria from HeLa cells  we treated them with oxamate or GSK A and then assessed LDH activity in either of two ways. First  we measured the ADP supported OCR of vehicle controls and com  pared them to purified mitochondria treated with drug  Fig.  a . We used a concentration of   mM for oxa  mate and   M for GSK A  since these con  centrations were determined to have comparable effects on LDH activity in HeLa cells  Fig.  . Importantly  puri  fied mitochondria were only provided malate   mM  and lactate   mM  as carbon sources in these experi  ments. We note that purified HeLa mitochondria do not respire well when only provided malate or lactate alone  presumably because they need a source of oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA for citrate synthase. Thus  under our ex  perimental conditions  respiration can only be supported by LDH oxidation of lactate. Interestingly  we found oxa  mate reduced the OCR by     while GSK A had no statistically significant effect relative to vehicle controls  Fig.  b .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   As a second method to assess LDH activity in purified HeLa cell mitochondria  we also used stable isotope tracers and LC MS. After purifying HeLa mitochondria  we incubated them in the same buffer as above  but we added U    C lactate for   min. We then used the in  corporation of two   C labels into citrate as an indicator of LDH activity. The M     isotopologue of citrate re  sults from the sequential actions of LDH  the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  and citrate synthase. Consistent with the OCR data  we found that oxamate reduced citrate labeling while GSK A treatment led to no statistically significant change relative to vehicle B A Fig.   Oxamate and GSK A inhibit LDH activity in HeLa cells. a Oxamate resembles pyruvate in structure and competes with pyruvate for LDH binding. GSK A competes with NAD for LDH binding. b Different concentrations of oxamate  oxa  and GSK A  GSK  achieved a similar level of LDH inhibition  as determined by measuring lactate excreted to the HeLa extracellular media after drug treatment. All data shown are averages from groups of n    . n.s.  no statistical difference A B C Fig.   Only oxamate significantly inhibits LDH activity when drugs are given to purified mitochondria from HeLa cells. a Mitochondria were first purified from HeLa cells and then given oxamate  oxa  or GSK A  GSK . b Oxygen consumption rate  OCR  from purified mitochondria provided lactate as a respiratory substrate. Each condition is compared to a vehicle control having an identical preparation  but without drug treatment. c M     labeling in citrate from purified mitochondria provided U    C lactate as a respiratory substrate. The M     isotopologue is significantly decreased due to oxamate  but not significantly different from the vehicle control due to GSK A treatment. All data shown are averages from groups of n    .  p  lt   .  n.s.  no statistical difference Niu et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   controls  Fig.  c . Together  these data are consistent with LDH localization to the mitochondrial matrix  where it is accessible to oxamate but not GSK A  rather than localization to the outer membrane or intermem  brane space . Having established that U    C lactate labeled TCA cycle intermediates differently when purified mitochondria were treated with oxamate versus GSK A  we sought to repeat the experiment with whole cells. We cultured HeLa cells in media containing   mM glucose and   mM U    C lactate for   h. For the duration of labeling  samples were treated either with   mM oxamate    M GSK A  or vehicle control  DMSO alone . After   h  intact cells were harvested and extracted for LC MS analysis. Strikingly  we observed only minimal labeling of TCA cycle intermediates in cells treated with oxamate  Fig.  . In contrast  labeling of cells treated with GSK A was not significantly different than vehicle controls. Notably  the labeling patterns we observed here for whole cells were consistent with the results obtained when the same experiment was performed on purified mitochon  dria  Fig.  c . As described above  Fig.  b  oxamate and GSK A both significantly decreased lactate produc  tion in whole cells when administered at the same concen  tration as in Fig.  . Taken together  these results are consistent with both oxamate and GSK A decreas  ing the reduction of pyruvate to lactate by inhibiting cyto  solic LDH  but only oxamate having access to inhibit mitochondrial LDH that is used for lactate oxidation. We note that the level of AMP was increased in HeLa cells treated with oxamate but not HeLa cells treated with GSK A  suggesting that mitochondrial LDH activity may influence cellular energy status  Additional file   Figure S   . To validate that   M GSK A can effect  ively inhibit mitochondrial LDH  we homogenized puri  fied mitochondria and assessed LDH activity after drug treatment by using a colorimetric assay. Compared to vehicle control  both   mM oxamate and   M GSK A decreased LDH activity by more than five fold  Fig.  . The decrease in LDH activity was less with a lower concentration of oxamate  but the results were comparable  Additional file   Figure S . These data indicate that GSK A can only access LDH after the inner mitochondrial membrane has been dis  rupted  which suggests that at least some LDH enzyme is localized to the HeLa mitochondrial matrix. Although we have focused on the metabolism of lactate by HeLa cells in the current study  additional data support that oxidation of lactate by mitochondria is relevant to other Fig.   TCA cycle labeling from U    C lactate is decreased when whole cells are treated with oxamate  but not when whole cells are treated with GSK A. These results are consistent with oxamate  oxa  inhibiting cytosolic and mitochondrial LDH  but with GSK A  GSK  only inhibiting cytosolic LDH.

Utilization of lactate in this capacity requires that lactate be oxidized by LDH  which could potentially occur in the cytosolic and or mitochondrial compart  ments of a cancer cell. While the difference between cytosolic and mitochondrial LDH activity only changes the location of two electrons  the regulatory implications of a compartmentalized shift in redox homeostasis are potentially significant. Many metabolic enzymes are reg  ulated by the ratio of NAD   to NADH  such as glyceral  dehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase in the cytosol and isocitrate dehydrogenase   in mitochondria  . The site of LDH activity may therefore have an important ef  fect on metabolic fluxes. Oxidation of lactate by cyto  solic LDH  for example  may slow glycolytic flux and glucose consumption  while oxidation of lactate by mito  chondrial LDH may promote lipid synthesis via the ac  cumulation of citrate    . Although the possibility of a mitochondrial LDH has been considered for several decades  disagreements persist about its precise location and its biochemical role  as has recently been reviewed in detail  . Progress in the field has been complicated by the technical limi  tations of localizing lactate metabolism within differ  ent subcellular compartments. Mitochondrial LDH cannot be assessed by tracing labels from   C lactate because of cytosolic lactate pyruvate exchange  . Imaging approaches have generally provided limited resolution to localize LDH to the mitochondrial matrix. Functional assays examining whether mamma  lian mitochondrial preparations oxidize lactate have provided mixed results. Thus  alternative experimental approaches to provide additional information about mitochondrial lactate metabolism are needed. We have described a strategy that exploits unique mito  chondrial transport properties of different small molecule inhibitors  oxamate and GSK A  to assess LDH location within cells. Interestingly  when evaluating intact purified mitochondria  oxamate decreased LDH activity but GSK A did not. Yet  both drugs had similar effects on LDH activity once mitochondria were disrupted  indicating differential access to LDH in previous experi  ments. Even though we have applied the approach to LDH here  the same approach can be broadly applied to investigate the spatial location of other enzymes. These data will be highly complementary to metabolomic and proteomic experiments performed on purified mitochon  dria and may provide key insights as we seek to under  stand the ways in which mitochondria are functionally integrated within the cell. We note that employing transport exclusion pharmacology requires having inhibi  tors with unique biochemical properties to mediate sub  cellular distribution  which are not available for many enzymes. However  we are optimistic that the rapidly growing interest in mitochondrial biology will inspire the development of such drugs not only for these types of A B Fig.   Both oxamate and GSK A significantly inhibit LDH activity in HeLa cell mitochondrial homogenates. a Mitochondria were first purified from HeLa cells and then homogenized before treating with oxamate  oxa  or GSK A  GSK . b LDH activity was measured by using a colorimetric assay.

Of particular interest  however  is the location of the enzyme within mitochondria. Its association with the outer mitochondrial membrane  the intermembrane space  or the outer leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane af  fects cytosolic redox balance. Its association with the inner leaflet of the inner membrane or the matrix  in contrast  af  fects mitochondrial redox balance. Intact purified mito  chondria given oxamate  a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate  show decreased LDH activity. GSK A  which is a competitive inhibitor of NAD  only affected LDH activity in mitochondrial homogenates when the inner mitochondrial membrane had been disrupted. These data are consistent with some mitochondrial LDH that is accessible to oxamate but not GSK A. Our approach of using small molecule inhibitors with different mitochondrial transport properties to localize protein activity is broadly applicable to the study of other enzymes.

Crawford   and Gary J. Patti    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Recent in vitro and in vivo work has shown that lactate provides an important source of carbon for metabolic reactions in cancer cell mitochondria. An interesting question is whether lactate is oxidized by lactate dehydrogenase  LDH  in the cytosol and or in mitochondria. Since metabolic processes in the cytosol and mitochondria are affected by redox balance  the location of LDH may have important regulatory implications in cancer metabolism. Methods  Within most mammalian cells  metabolic processes are physically separated by membrane bound compartments. Our general understanding of this spatial organization and its role in cellular function  however  suffers from the limited number of techniques to localize enzymatic activities within a cell. Here  we describe an approach to assess metabolic compartmentalization by monitoring the activity of pharmacological inhibitors that cannot be transported into specific cellular compartments. Results  Oxamate  which chemically resembles pyruvate  is transported into mitochondria and inhibits LDH activity in purified mitochondria. GSK A  in contrast  is a competitive inhibitor of NAD  which cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. GSK A did not inhibit the LDH activity of intact mitochondria  but GSK A did inhibit LDH activity after the inner mitochondrial membrane was disrupted. Conclusions  Our results are consistent with some mitochondrial LDH that is accessible to oxamate  but inaccessible to GSK A until mitochondria are homogenized. This strategy of using inhibitors with selective access to subcellular compartments  which we refer to as transport exclusion pharmacology  is broadly applicable to localize other metabolic reactions within cells. ,446,14.152466367713005

186692, sec map section chunk M E T H O D O L O G Y Open Access A rapid method for quantifying free and bound acetate based on alkylation and GC MS analysis Sergey Tumanov     Vinay Bulusu     Eyal Gottlieb   and Jurre J. Kamphorst    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Acetyl CoA is a key metabolic intermediate with roles in the production of energy and biomass  as well as in metabolic regulation. It was recently found that acetate is crucial for maintaining acetyl CoA production in hypoxic cancer cells. However  the availability of free acetate in the tumor environment and how much tumor cells consume remains unknown. Similarly  much is still to be learned about changes in the dynamics and distribution of acetylation in response to tumor relevant conditions. The analysis of acetate is non trivial  and to help address these topics  we developed a rapid and robust method for the analysis of both free and bound acetate in biological samples. Results  We developed a sensitive and high throughput method for the analysis of acetate based on alkylation to its propyl derivative and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The method facilitates simultaneous quantification of both   C  and   C acetate  shows high reproducibility  lt      RSD  and has a wide linear range of quantification   M . We demonstrate the methods utility by measuring free acetate uptake by cultured cancer cells and by quantifying total acetylation  using hydrolysis  in separate cellular compartments. Additionally  we measure free acetate in tissues and bio fluids and show that there are considerable differences in acetate concentrations between organs in vivo  providing insights into its complex systemic metabolism and availability for various types of tumors. Conclusions  Our approach for the quantification of acetate is straightforward to implement using widely available equipment and reagents  and will aid in in depth investigation of various aspects of acetate metabolism. It is also readily adaptable to the analysis of formate and short chain fatty acids  making it highly relevant to the cancer metabolism community. Keywords  Acetate  ACSS  Butyrate  Cancer metabolism  Formate  GC MS  Histone acetylation  Stable isotope labeling  chunk section section heading Background  heading chunk Cancer cells have an incessant drive to proliferate  caus  ing an unremitting demand for cellular building blocks to make new cells  . Among these building blocks are fatty acids that are incorporated into membrane lipids. Cancer cells acquire a significant proportion of their non essential fatty acids through de novo synthesis  . The precursor for fatty acid synthesis is acetyl  CoA  AcCoA  of which the  carbon acetyl units are ligated to make the fatty acid palmitate  which in turn is subjected to elongation and desaturation reactions to generate a diversity of fatty acids. AcCoA is located centrally in both catabolic and ana  bolic pathways. Therefore  it also acts as a rheostat of a cells metabolic state. This occurs in part by a direct ef  fect of AcCoA on enzyme activity through allosteric regulation and other means    . Additionally  enzyme activity is modulated by protein acetylation. Indeed  most enzymes of central carbon metabolism are acety  lated to control activity  . Acetylation is especially prominent on histones and is important for controlling gene expression  . Based on this  it is not surpris  ing that acetyl transferases  sirtuins  and histone deace  tylases have been found to play important roles in tumorigenesis    .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     DOI  . s  Because of its role in biomass production  cancer cells have a high demand for AcCoA. In nutrient and oxygen  replete conditions  this demand is largely met by mito  chondrial AcCoA production from glucose carbon. This AcCoA is then used to make citrate  which in turn is transported to the cytosol to produce cytosolic AcCoA. In hypoxic conditions  however  most glucose is shunted towards lactate  and AcCoA production from glucose is diminished    . The observation of a concomitant increase in citrate M   labeling from U    C glutamine has led to the finding that glutamine  through reductive carboxylation  is used to make AcCoA    . However  the exact net carbon contribution is still debated  . Recently  a third substrate was found to sustain AcCoA synthesis  especially in hypoxic and highly glycolytic tumor cells  acetate      . AcCoA synthesis from acetate occurs through AcCoA synthetases  ACSS  and the nucleocytosolic ACSS  was found to be important for maintaining tumor growth    . As we discussed previously  while the fractional label  ing of nucleocytosolic AcCoA from U    C acetate has been determined   this may not reflect the actual carbon contribution. The  carbon units from AcCoA could exchange back and forth with acetate  causing mixing of label that is not a representative of net flux. In extreme cases  significant labeling of AcCoA  and hence fatty acids  from acetate may be observed without a net carbon contribution  . Conversely  a potential exchange between intermediates from other substrates  like glutam  ine  would lead to an under representation of the contri  bution from acetate. Therefore  an exact understanding of acetates importance as a carbon source requires direct analysis of acetate uptake by cells. Such a method could additionally be used for analysis of acetylation dynamics in cells  a subject that remains understudied. Over the years  methods based on a number of princi  ples have been developed for the analysis of acetate. An older method includes enrichment of acetate using a distillation diffusion unit based on mixing the sample with anhydrous sodium sulfate and sulfuric acid and heating in the distillation bulb  . The then formed acetic acid is captured by water in the receiving tube and then measured using radioactivity  using   C acetate    or flame ionization gas chromatography    . Later on  enzymatic assays and NMR gained popularity. These approaches facilitate acetate quantitation but lack the combined strength of high sensitivity  the abil  ity to use stable isotopes to determine turnover  and short analysis times. The use of mass spectrometry is promising in this regard  but due to the small size of acetate  it depends on a reliable derivatization ap  proach. Over the recent years  a number of papers ad  dressing this have been published  based on silylation and alkylation  . Here  we present a GC MS based method that was fully optimized and validated for the accurate determin  ation of both free and bound acetate. This method is based on alkylation of acetate to propyl acetate. It is rapid in terms of sample preparation and analysis and was found to behave favorably in terms of accuracy  re  peatability  and linear concentration range. It also mini  mizes background levels of acetate  a problem that can easily complicate the analysis of this metabolite and of longer chain fatty acids. We demonstrate the methods utility by studying uptake of U    C acetate from the medium by cultured cancer cells. We also show that free acetate levels differ considerably between organs  in vivo  indicating that acetate availability for tumors depends on their anatomical location. In addition  we determine the bound acetate content of the cell and its sub cellular fractions  i.e.  nuclear bound acetate . Finally  we show that by using alternative alkylating agents  other com  pounds with clear relevance in cancer  like formate  can also be measured. Thus  the method described here will facilitate in depth investigation into the role of acetate  and with slight modification  of other short chain fatty acids in cancer.

Extraction of total acetate from cells For quantification of bound acetate in various cellular fractions  i.e.  nuclear and residual cellular fractions  we used a nuclear extraction kit  Merck Millipore  as per the vendors protocol. Acidic extraction of histones was performed as described previously  . For the fraction  ation procedures  the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with buffers provided by the kit  all containing   mM nicotinamide  Sigma  and   mM sodium butyr  ate  Sigma . The efficiency of fractionation was verified by western blot  using NuPage gels  Invitrogen  Life Technologies  and nitrocellulose membranes. Lysates for western blot were prepared in RIPA buffer  Pierce  with a protease inhibitor cocktail  Sigma . Tubulin   Sigma  T  and TATA binding protein  TBP    Abcam  ab  were used as cytosolic and nuclear markers  respectively. Histone fraction purity was con  firmed by staining with Ponceau S  BioRad . Protein concentrations for the isolated cellular fractions were determined using Bradford Protein Assay Kit  Bio Rad . Extraction of total  free and bound  cellular acetate was performed by saponification of the cell pellet in so  dium hydroxide. Cell pellets obtained by trypsinizing cells in  well plates were transferred to pre chilled  ice temperature  microfuge tubes  centrifuged at  g and   C for   min and washed with ice cold PBS containing   mM nicotinamide and   mM sodium butyrate   and finally centrifuged at   C at  g for   min. Bound acetate hydrolysis was performed by saponifying   L of the extract through overnight incubation with   L   M sodium hydroxide in a microfuge tube at   C. Each sample was then cooled on ice before adding   L of concentrated hydrochloric acid  followed by addition of   L   mM internal standard sodium   H    acetate and drying by SpeedVac. The dried samples were reconstituted in   L of water and further derivatized as below. Quantification of free acetate in tissues and bio fluids All animal work was performed in accordance with the European Directive  EU and approved by ethical review process from the University of Glasgow. The heart  spleen  pancreas  kidney  liver  thymus  and lung tissues as well as urine and plasma were obtained from C BL  mice  n     for tissues and n     for plasma and urine . Samples were snap frozen on dry ice directly after collection  and tissues were ground using a mortar and pestle  both dry ice temperature .

The homogenates were then transferred into ice chilled microfuge tubes  the lysing tubes were rinsed with   L methanol  water   v v  and fractions combined. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed at   C for   min  and supernatant was transferred to a new micro  fuge tube and dried by SpeedVac. Dried tissue extracts were resuspended in   L water and derivatized as below. Mouse urine and plasma samples were directly subjected to derivatization using the procedure below.

Sample derivatization and analysis Chemical derivatization of acetate Note  because of the organic solvents and reagents  the derivatization should be performed in a fume hood.   L of sample was added to a   mL microfuge tube  followed by addition of   L of   mM internal standard sodium   H    acetate  unless this was already added    L of  propanol  and   L of pyridine. The tube was then placed on ice for   min.   L of   M sodium hydroxide was then added  immediately followed by   L MCF and vigorous vortexing for   s. As gas builds up in the microfuge tube during the derivatization reaction  keep the lid closed with one finger and care  fully open after vortexing to relieve pressure or keep the lid open during vortexing. After vortexing    L of MTBE was added  the sample vortexed for another   s  and centrifuged at  g for   min.   L microliters of the resulting upper layer was transferred to a GC vial for analysis. Acetate quantification by GC MS The acetate samples were analyzed with an Agilent  B GC system coupled to a   Triple Quadrupole GC MS system.

Peak heights of   C and U    C acetate were compared to the   H    acetate peak height  and absolute concentrations were obtained from a calibration curve. Results and discussion Method description We developed a robust and high throughput method for absolute acetate quantification in biological samples. The method is based on derivatization using an established re  action with methyl chloroformate  MCF     . After sequentially adding internal standard   propanol  pyri  dine  and sodium hydroxide  the derivatization reaction is initiated by adding MCF as soon as possible. The chemical modification occurs in basic conditions due to the pres  ence of sodium hydroxide  while pyridine keeps the reac  tion system homogeneous as MCF does not dissolve in water alone  Fig.  .  Propanol is used as a coupling reagent to produce propyl acetate  Fig.  . When sodium hydroxide is added to the cooled sample immediately prior to MCF addition  no hydrolysis occurs  see below . Alkylation of acetate with MCF facilitates rapid further modification of acetate in water based conditions. In this case  the acetate MCF intermediate  I  is attacked by the alcohol  propanol  and the resultant intermediate  II  undergoes further rearrangements  leading to the forma  tion of propyl acetate. Such derivatization approaches using the chloroformate family of reagents are well described    . To quantify the yield of the derivatiza  tion and subsequent extraction into MTBE  we compared the MS signal intensity of   mM of acetate alkylated to propyl acetate to an equimolar concentration of commer  cially obtained propyl acetate in MTBE. Based on this  we found the recovery to be  .   .     Additional file   Table S . The derivatization reaction with MCF is vigorous and exothermic  producing gases  hydrochloric gas  carbon dioxide  that cause pressure to increase within the tube. We therefore recommend following general health and safety rules when performing chemical derivatization  Table   GC temperature program for acetate analysis Start temperature  C  Ramp  C min  End temperature  C  Hold time  min       .                  Fig.   Schematic representation of the workflow for rapid acetate quantification. A sample aliquot was mixed with internal standard sodium   H    acetate  pyridine  Py  and  propanol  PrOH  followed by derivatization by adding sodium hydroxide and methyl chloroformate  MCF . After the derivatization  the sample was mixed with methyl tert butyl ether  MTBE  and vortexed in order to extract acetate derivative  propyl acetate . Thereafter  the sample was spun down and the top MTBE layer was transferred into GC vial for further GC MS analysis Tumanov et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   i.e.  wear a lab coat  gloves  and protective glasses  while carrying out the reaction in a fume hood. To minimize the vigor of the reaction and hence pressurization  it is important to incubate the sample on ice   min  prior to derivatization. We recommend keeping the lid closed with one finger during vortexing and to carefully open the tube afterwards  a popping sound can be heard . Alternatively  the tube can be kept opened during the vortexing  depending on the researchers preference  we find that the tubes contents do not spill when handled carefully . Afterwards  the derivatized acetate  propyl  acetate  can be easily extracted into organic solvent  MTBE  followed by the GC MS analysis  Fig.  . Other primary alcohols  e.g.  methanol and ethanol producing methyl and ethyl acetate  respectively  also can be used for derivatization. However  we found that with our mid polar GC column  which we find to be very suitable for the analysis of a broad range of metabo  lites  propyl acetate provides the optimal peak shape and retention time for rapid analysis. The sample prep  aration protocol described here is very rapid with a total derivatization time of a less than   min per sample. Together with the short GC MS program with a total run time of   min per sample  this facilitates high  throughput analysis. While the acetate isotopologues   C acetate  U    C acetate  and   H    acetate have almost identical retention times  their peaks can be easily deconvoluted using specific ions  Fig.  . As is generally observed in GC analysis of deuterated analytes  the   H     acetate derivative has a slightly shorter retention time due to inverse isotope effect  . Ions m z     and   for   C    acetate  U    C    acetate  and   H    acetate  re  spectively  were used for absolute quantification and showed optimal linear response. Method validation To assess the repeatability of the sample preparation and analysis procedure  we determined the relative standard deviation  RSD  for   C  and U    C acetate in freshly prepared standards at     and   M for the respective acetate isotopologues. The method showed excellent repeatability with a RSD  lt      for standards and  lt      for biological samples  Additional file   Table S . The linear range of quantification was assessed by analysis of serially diluted standards of both   C  and U    C acetate within the range     M. We were unable to determine the limit of detection  LOD  for   C acetate as a background acet  ate signal of approximately   M was always present in our samples  even though only reagents of the highest purity were used. It appears that acetate is a common trace contaminant in the atmosphere and reagents as well as in the plastic and glassware  simi  lar to what has been observed for longer chain fatty acids    . To investigate this further  we sought to determine the exact sources of background acetate  Additional file   Figure S . As we analyze acetate in its derivatized propyl acetate form  the background signal that we commonly observe could be either from propyl acetate directly or from background acet  ate that is derivatized to propyl acetate during the sample preparation. To look at the presence of back  ground propyl acetate  we performed an experiment in both plastic and glassware where we analyzed the level of propyl acetate in reagents used for chemical derivatization. We observed that  propanol has the highest background propyl acetate  but that it accounts for only     of the background acetate observed in pro  cedure blanks  PB  i.e. blank samples that have been Fig.   Chemical derivatization of acetate.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   subjected to the entire sample preparation and mass spec analysis procedure  indicating that free acetate  rather than propyl acetate is the major contaminant. Unfortu  nately  all the reagents are needed for the derivatization  so we are unable to determine what reagent contains the most background acetate. We did  however  perform the entire derivatization and extraction procedure on blank samples in both glass and plastic tubes. We found that in plastic  the resulting acetate background is     higher than in glass. Due to its convenience  we still prefer to work with plastic tubes and we leave this decision to the individual investigator. Regardless of the background acetate  as the response proved highly linear  we were able to subtract the back  ground signal  we quantify acetate background using blank samples that have been subjected to the entire sample preparation and mass spec analysis procedure  i.e.  procedure blanks  resulting in a linear dynamic range from   to   M for both   C acetate and U    C acetate. The determined limit of quantification  LOQ  for U    C acetate was  .  M. To keep   C acetate contamination to a minimum  we recommend preparing fresh reagents regularly  weekly  and we also recommend including procedure blanks routinely. Of note  we suggest users to quantify their own background acetate signal as it depends on the materials and reagents used and  there  fore  it is very likely to be lab specific. We consider our approach to be an optimized alterna  tive to other published derivatization methods  for the rapid measurement of acetate  . An approach based on silylation of acetate with N tert Butyldimethylsilyl  N methyltrifluoroacetamide  MTBSTFA  showed a wide linear range for acetate quantification     M  high repeatability and low relative standard deviation  RSD  lt       . It is  however  not suitable for processing water based samples  the multiple ex  traction steps may lead to high background acetate levels  and the MS run time is long for analysis of acetate alone. An approach based on alkylation using propyl chloroformate  PCF  is similar to ours with re  spect to methodology and analytical performance but uses larger reagent volumes  which increases the risk for high acetate background levels  and longer MS run times as it was not optimized for acetate specifically  and it does not mention formate  . The published lower limit of quantification was comparable to our method   M for current method versus   M re  ported by Zheng et al.  . Zheng et al.   reported wider range of linear response  i.e.    M  mM. We did not test beyond   mM as we have not observed such high levels in a physiological context. The re  ported repeatability was observed to be very similar with  .    RSD  n     reported by Zheng et al.   and  .    RSD  n     depending on the acet  ate concentration  reported in current method for standard samples  relative standard deviations summa  rized in Additional file   Table S . Finally  another GC MS based method for the analysis of short chain fatty acids used  difluoroaniline and  dicyclocar  bodiimide as condensation reagents  which necessi  tated  h incubation step  . Overall  the work presented here contributes the following  in addition Fig.   GC chromatogram for acetate derivative  propyl acetate . a Total ion chromatogram. bd Extracted ion chromatograms for   C  U    C  and   H    acetate  respectively.

The sample preparation protocol includes the addition of sodium hydroxide to facilitate the alkylation reaction. While this happens immediately prior to the derivatiza  tion reaction and the samples are cooled  this could potentially result in unwanted hydrolysis of acetylated bio molecules  leading to increased levels of free acetate. To test if this occurs  we performed sample preparation and analysis on   mM solutions of N acetyl L aspartic acid  NAA  and N acetyl L cysteine  NAC    g L of BSA as well as procedure blanks. As amino acid acetyl  ation is the most abundant source of bound acetate  and we did not observe a significant increase in signal  we conclude that the contribution from hydrolyzed bound acetate is negligible  Fig.  . Acetate quantification in biological samples Having established that our method can accurately and reproducibly quantify acetate  we next wanted to deter  mine if it can reproduce previously established results. We therefore quantified acetate in plasma from eight healthy individuals. The plasma acetate concentrations varied from   to   M with a median concentration of  .   .  M  data not shown . This falls within the previously published values of  .   .  M   and  .   .  M  Human Metabolome Database  .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Recently  multiple studies identified an important role for the enzyme acetyl CoA synthetase    ACSS  in me  diating tumor growth during hypoxic and nutrient  limited conditions      . ACSS  activates acetate to AcCoA so that it can be used for downstream meta  bolic reactions  including lipogenesis. Indeed  addition of U    C acetate to the medium of cultured cancer cells revealed increased labeling of lipogenic AcCoA  and consequently fatty acids  in hypoxic relative to normoxic conditions    . However  to what extent this in  creased labeling is caused by an increase in acetate up  take remains unknown. To address this  we cultured A  lung carcinoma cells in normoxic or hypoxic     O     conditions in medium containing   M U    C acetate  and followed its concentration over time using our new method  Fig.  . Consistent with the ob  served labeling of lipogenic AcCoA from U    C acet  ate  a robust consumption of U    C acetate by hypoxic cells was observed  as evidenced by a clear reduction in the medium. Surprisingly  while labeling of lipogenic AcCoA in normoxic conditions is considerably less than in hypoxia     normoxic cells also displayed avid U    C acetate consumption. The acetate uptake rates for hypoxic cells were with  .   .  nmole h L cells  PCV  modestly higher than for normoxic cells  .   .  nmole h L cells . These results suggest that the increased labeling of lipogenic AcCoA from U    C  acetate in hypoxia  fold increase  data not shown  cannot be fully explained by increased acetate uptake. Instead  the increased labeling is likely partly caused by a drop in production of lipogenic AcCoA from glucose in hypoxic cells  leading to inflation of the relative con  tribution from acetate. We are in the process of investi  gating this further. Free acetate concentration in mouse tissues and fluids In vivo isotope tracing experiments demonstrated the utilization of exogenous acetate by tumors     con  firming a critical role for ACSS  in mediating growth in various cancers  . However  the availability of acetate for solid tumors and how this varies between host or  gans remains largely unknown. In an attempt to address this  we analyzed tissues from multiple mouse  C BL  organs  heart  kidney  liver  lung  pancreas  spleen  thy  mus  as well as plasma and urine  Fig.  . Of all the organs analyzed  the liver contained the highest con  centration of free acetate with an average concentration of  .   .  nmole of acetate per mg of tissue  i.e.    mM  more than twice as much as any other tissue. Nutrients absorbed by the intestine will first pass through the liver via the portal vein. High millimolar concentrations of acetate and other short chain fatty acids have been reported to be generated by gut micro  biota   and this provides a rationale for the high acetate concentration in the liver. As the concentration of acetate in the liver is much higher than in systemic circulation  i.e.  plasma  and the lungs  which contain the first capillary system to be perfused by blood after liver passage  the liver appears to capture substantial amounts of acetate for metabolic use. Acetate was also considerably enriched in the pancreas and kidney rela  tive to plasma  with concentrations of  .   .  and  .   .  nmole mg  .  and  .  mM  respectively. The reason for high acetate in the pancreas remains to be elucidated. One function of the kidneys is to clear water soluble excess or toxic metabolites from the blood and considering that the acetate concentration in urine is substantially higher than in plasma  acetate may actually be actively excreted from the body as Fig.   Concentration of free acetate in mouse samples. Whisker plots of  a  the heart  kidney  liver  lung  pancreas  spleen  and thymus tissues as well as for  b  plasma and urine were obtained from C BL . Snap frozen tissues were ground  and tissue aliquots were used for free acetate quantification. Data are means SD of tissue  n     and fluid  n     samples. Horizontal line and dot on box plot correspond to median value and outlier  respectively. Upper and lower end of box plot vertical line are maximum and minimum determined values  respectively. Upper and lower horizontal lines of a box are the   rd and the   st quartile  respectively Tumanov et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Fig.    See legend on next page.  Tumanov et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   metabolic waste. Acetate levels were considerably less in other tissues with the lowest value found in the spleen at a concentration similar to plasma. Together  these observations highlight that the availability of acet  ate may vary considerably between organs  which has implications for tumor metabolism. Analysis of bound acetate in  sub cellular and histone fractions AcCoA occupies a central node in metabolism and is involved in biomass synthesis  catabolic pathways  and energy production. Because of this  AcCoA plays an im  portant role in metabolic regulation  . This occurs in part through acetylation of bio molecules  including a variety of proteins  . For example  acetylation of his  tones promotes gene transcription and a correlation between degree of histone acetylation and tumor aggres  siveness has been observed  . Further evidence for the importance of acetylation homeostasis in cancer pro  gression comes from the observation that disrupting acetylation dynamics by inhibiting deacetylases  i.e.  HDACs  sirtuins  leads to potent induction of cancer cell death    . While several aspects of acetylation are being extensively studied  much remains unknown about absolute pool sizes and turnover of acetate bound to bio molecules in the various cell compartments  let alone how they are affected by tumor relevant condi  tions. To address this  we combined our approach with hydrolysis in basic conditions. By heating samples and incubating them overnight with sodium hydroxide  ester bonds hydrolyze  releasing free acetate  which can then be derivatized and analyzed as before. Using this approach on a whole cell extract allowed us to quantify total  bound   free  acetate in A  cells at  .  mole mg total cel  lular protein. We next asked if it would be possible to quantify bound acetate in separate cell compartments. We achieved a near complete separation of the nuclear and residual cellular fractions  combination of cytosol and organelles other than the nucleus  using a commer  cial nuclear isolation kit  see Methods section   Fig.  b . We found that the bound acetate content was approximately equal for the nuclear and residual frac  tions  Fig.  c . The sum of both fractions equaled     of the whole cell measurement  which is most likely caused by reduced recovery during fractionation  but may also be caused by loss of free acetate. Expressing the acetate content per mg protein in each fraction revealed that the acetylation density in the nu  cleus is approximately threefold higher than in the re  sidual cell fraction  Fig.  d . Histones are known to be heavily acetylated  and to determine how much of the nuclear acetate was histone bound  we compared the results of the nuclear isolation approach with a pub  lished acidic histone extraction protocol  Fig.  eg   . Both approaches gave very similar values  indicat  ing that nearly all bound acetate in the nuclear fraction is due to histone acetylation. Thus  histone acetylation alone accounts for half of the total cellular acetate. This approach towards quantifying histone bound acetate may help to better understand the effect of his  tone acetylation in various cancer related studies. To demonstrate the utility of the approach  we treated A  cells with panobinostat  a pan histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitor. A short   h incubation with panobino  stat caused a near doubling in the amount of histone  bound acetate  demonstrating that histone acetylation turnover is quite fast  Fig.  h . Measuring formate and other short chain fatty acids By modifying the derivatization agent  the method is read  ily adaptable to other short chain fatty acids  including formate. Coupling formate with benzyl alcohol generates formate derivative  benzyl formate  which can be readily analyzed by GC MS  see supplemental experimental pro  cedures Additional file   S . We mentioned before that the GC MS method for acetate analysis takes only   min  with mass detector operating between  .  and  .  min. The same method is able to analyze and quantify propion  ate and butyrate in the form of propyl propionate and propyl butyrate using the same sample derivatization method setup as for acetate. By extending mass detector operation time from  .  to   min  we were able to detect the propionate and butyrate peaks eluting at  .  and  .  min  respectively. Using ions m z   and   for pro  pionate and butyrate  respectively  it is possible to abso  lutely quantify these short chain fatty acids.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk Here  we presented a robust and high throughput method for absolute quantification of acetate using gas chromatography mass spectrometry.

Kamphorst    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Acetyl CoA is a key metabolic intermediate with roles in the production of energy and biomass  as well as in metabolic regulation. It was recently found that acetate is crucial for maintaining acetyl CoA production in hypoxic cancer cells. However  the availability of free acetate in the tumor environment and how much tumor cells consume remains unknown. Similarly  much is still to be learned about changes in the dynamics and distribution of acetylation in response to tumor relevant conditions. The analysis of acetate is non trivial  and to help address these topics  we developed a rapid and robust method for the analysis of both free and bound acetate in biological samples. Results  We developed a sensitive and high throughput method for the analysis of acetate based on alkylation to its propyl derivative and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The method facilitates simultaneous quantification of both   C  and   C acetate  shows high reproducibility  lt      RSD  and has a wide linear range of quantification   M . We demonstrate the methods utility by measuring free acetate uptake by cultured cancer cells and by quantifying total acetylation  using hydrolysis  in separate cellular compartments. Additionally  we measure free acetate in tissues and bio fluids and show that there are considerable differences in acetate concentrations between organs in vivo  providing insights into its complex systemic metabolism and availability for various types of tumors. Conclusions  Our approach for the quantification of acetate is straightforward to implement using widely available equipment and reagents  and will aid in in depth investigation of various aspects of acetate metabolism. It is also readily adaptable to the analysis of formate and short chain fatty acids  making it highly relevant to the cancer metabolism community. ,545,14.499082568807339

186772, sec map section chunk R E S E A R C H Open Access CHCHD  confers metabolic vulnerabilities to tumour cells through its control of the mitochondrial respiratory chain Luke W. Thomas     Jenna M. Stephen     Cinzia Esposito     Simon Hoer     Robin Antrobus     Afshan Ahmed     Hasan Al Habib   and Margaret Ashcroft    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Tumour cells rely on glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation  OXPHOS  to survive. Thus  mitochondrial OXPHOS has become an increasingly attractive area for therapeutic exploitation in cancer. However  mitochondria are required for intracellular oxygenation and normal physiological processes  and it remains unclear which mitochondrial molecular mechanisms might provide therapeutic benefit. Previously  we discovered that coiled coil helix coiled coil helix domain containing protein    CHCHD  is critical for regulating intracellular oxygenation and required for the cellular response to hypoxia  low oxygenation  in tumour cells through molecular mechanisms that we do not yet fully understand. Overexpression of CHCHD  in human cancers correlates with increased tumour progression and poor patient survival. Results  Here  we show that elevated CHCHD  expression provides a proliferative and metabolic advantage to tumour cells in normoxia and hypoxia. Using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture  SILAC  and analysis of the whole mitochondrial proteome  we show that CHCHD  dynamically affects the expression of a broad range of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits from complex IV  including multiple subunits of complex I  CI  required for complex assembly that are essential for cell survival. We found that loss of CHCHD  protects tumour cells from respiratory chain inhibition at CI  while elevated CHCHD  expression in tumour cells leads to significantly increased sensitivity to CI inhibition  in part through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species  ROS . Conclusions  Our study highlights an important role for CHCHD  in regulating tumour cell metabolism and reveals that CHCHD  confers metabolic vulnerabilities to tumour cells through its control of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and CI biology.

As such  CHCHD  controls the import of a num  ber of mitochondrial proteins that contain a twin CX   C or twin CX   C motif  . Additionally  as a compo  nent of the DRS  CHCHD  participates in electron transfer to complex IV  CIV  the molecular oxygen ac  ceptor of the respiratory chain  . We and others have found that the functionally conserved cysteines within the redox sensitive Cys Pro Cys  CPC  domain of CHCHD  regulate its mitochondrial localisation in yeast   and human cells    . Recently  we discovered that CHCHD  regulates intracellular oxygenation in tumour cells  which is dependent on the functionally im  portant cysteines of the CPC motif and CIV activity  . In this study  using both loss  and gain of function ap  proaches  we have further explored the mitochondrial mechanism s  by which CHCHD  regulates respiratory chain function and tumour cell metabolism.  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Cell culture and cell line generation Human osteosarcoma U OS control and independent clonal cell lines  WT.cl  and WT.cl  expressing CHCHD .  cDNA  CHCHD WT expressing cells  or CHCHD C A C A cDNA  CHCHD C A C A  expressing cells  have been described by us recently  .

Previously  we demonstrated that CHCHD  is required for maintaining basal cellular  OCR    and intracellular oxygenation in tumour cells  . Recently  we found that loss of CHCHD  in renal carcinoma cells leads to decreased expression of a range of respiratory chain subunits including NDUFS   CI  SDHA  complex II  CII  UQCRC   complex III  CIII  and COXIV  CIV    indicating that CHCHD  controls the expression of a broader range of respiratory chain subunits than had previously been considered. Thus  we hypothesised that CHCHD  affects basal cellular OCR and intracellular oxygenation by altering the expression levels of respira  tory chain subunits. To investigate the extent to which CHCHD  affects respiratory chain subunit expression and other mitochondrial proteins  we performed stable isotope labelling with amino acid in cell culture  SILAC  using L lysine    C       N    Lys  and L arginine    C       N    Arg  parallel double labelling of shRNA control and CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown cells  as well as CHCHD   WT expressing cells and control cells  Fig.  a . Mitochondria were isolated and mass spectro  photometry performed. Approximately   pro  teins were analysed from up to three independent parallel double labelling SILAC experiments  Fig.  b  c . Our analysis of proteins isolated from mitochondria of respectively labelled cells confirmed a significant de  crease in CHCHD  protein in CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown compared to shRNA control cells  Fig.  b  and a significant increase in CHCHD  protein in CHCHD   WT expressing cells compared to control cells  Fig.  c . We observed respective decreased and in  creased expression of several known CHCHD  sub  strates containing a twin CX n C motif including COX  COA  TIMM  CHCHD  and TIMM      as well as other putative CHCHD  substrates  Fig.  d and Table   while expression of proteins such as the outer mitochondrial membrane protein sorting and assembly machinery component   homologue  SAMM  did not change. Most interestingly  we observed significant and dynamic changes in a broad range of respiratory chain subunits involving CI  CII  CIII and CIV  Fig.  eg  Additional file   and Table  . Notably  we observed more significant protein changes in response to loss of CHCHD   Fig.  b  Table   compared to CHCHD  overexpression  Fig.  c  Table   which was likely related to the respective differences in significance for CHCHD  expression in each of these conditions  Table  . Importantly  we consistently observed that fold changes of identified proteins in response to loss or gain of CHCHD  expression were decreased and increased respectively across multiple SILAC experiments  Fig.   and Table  . To confirm our SILAC findings  we examined the ex  pression of individual subunits of CI  CII  CIII and CIV in whole cell and enriched mitochondrial fractions by western analyses. Consistent with our SILAC analyses  we found reduced expression of individual subunits of CI  NDUFS  CII  SDHA  CIII  UQCRC  and CIV  COXIV  in enriched mitochondrial fractions isolated from stable CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown cells com  pared to shRNA control cells  Fig.  f  . Depletion of CHCHD  using two independent siRNAs similarly re  duced the expression of these respiratory chain subunits  Additional file  b  as we have also shown in our recent study using renal carcinoma cells  . Furthermore  consistent with a previous report   we found that loss of CHCHD  also reduced the expression of AIF protein  as well as GFER  Additional file  c  without affecting their respective mRNA expression  Additional file  d . Conversely  we found elevated levels of subunits of CI  NDUFS  CII  SDHA  CIII  UQCRC  and CIV  COXIV  in whole cell lysates and in enriched mito  chondrial fractions isolated from CHCHD   WT ex  pressing cells compared to control cells Fig.  g. However  these respiratory chain subunits were not in  creased in cells expressing a mutant form of CHCHD   C A C A  in which the functionally critical cysteines of the substrate binding CPC motif have been substituted by alanine and is defective in mitochondrial Thomas et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   a b f g h e i d c j k Fig.    See legend on next page.  Thomas et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   localisation and import function      Fig.  g . We noted that stable expression of the CHCHD   C A  C A  mutant protein compared to CHCHD   WT  pro  tein was much reduced in respective independent cell lines  Fig.  g . Despite this  we found that respiratory chain subunit expression in CHCHD   C A C A ex  pressing cells were in some instances below basal levels found in control cells  see Fig.  g  WCL for NDUFS  and SDHA proteins . These data collectively indicate that the mutant form of CHCHD   C A C A  may behave as a dominant negative  and as such  high levels of CHCHD   C A C A  expression in cells might not be tolerated. Interestingly  we observed no significant change in mito  chondrial mass when CHCHD  expression was manipu  lated as assessed either by measuring mitochondrial  mt DNA copy number  Fig.  h  i  or by staining with the fluorescent mitochondrial marker  MitoView  Add  itional file  e . Moreover  mitochondrial membrane poten  tial was similar in mitochondria isolated from CHCHD   WT expressing cells  CHCHD   C A C A expres  sing cells and control cells  Additional file  f . Expression of the inner membrane protein prohibitin    PHB  served as a control protein for these experiments as it did not change in response to either CHCHD   WT or C A  C A  expression or CHCHD  knockdown  Fig.  f  g . Previously  we showed that transient siRNA knockdown and overexpression of CHCHD  decreased and increased basal cellular OCR  respectively  . Consistently  we found that stable shRNA knockdown of CHCHD  led to a significant decrease in cellular OCR  Fig.  j . Furthermore  we found that both basal and maximal cellular OCRs were significantly increased in CHCHD   WT expressing cells  but not in mutant CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells  Fig.  k . Collectively  our data indicate that modula  tion of CHCHD  expression leads to global and dynamic effects on the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits and concomitant changes in basal OCR. CHCHD  promotes basal and adaptive metabolic responses and provides a proliferative advantage to tumour cells We have previously reported that overexpression of CHCHD  in human cancers correlates with a hypoxia gene signature and increased tumour progression and me  tastasis  disease recurrence and poor patient survival  . As our SILAC analyses demonstrated significant changes in the expression of respiratory chain subunits  next we assessed the effect of CHCHD  expression on tumour cell metabolism and growth in normoxia and hypoxia. In nor  moxia  we observed significantly decreased L lactate levels  Fig.  a  and extracellular acidification rate  ECAR   Fig.  b  in CHCHD   WT expressing cells compared with control or CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells. Moreover  the rate of uptake of the fluorescent glucose analogue  NBDG  N nitrobenz oxa diazo  l yl amino deoxyglucose  was slower in CHCHD   WT expressing cells compared with control U OS cells  while CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells had higher uptake  Fig.  c . Together  these data indicate that in  creased respiratory chain subunit expression correlates with decreased glycolysis in response to elevated CHCHD  expression in normoxia  and decreased fermen  tation of pyruvate to lactate. In contrast to our findings in normoxia  we observed significantly increased L lactate  See figure on previous page.

Taken together  our data suggest that CHCHD mediated effects on the respiratory chain regu  late both basal  normoxic  and adaptive  hypoxic  meta  bolic tumour cell responses and growth. CHCHD  expression confers increased tumour cell sensitivity to CI inhibitors Homozygous deletion of chchd  in mice  which is em  bryonic lethal  results in a decrease in whole CI expres  sion   and human CI deficiency which is fatal is associated with a cysteine mutation within the CI accessory subunit NDUFB  which is a CHCHD  sub  strate  . Our SILAC analyses of CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown and shRNA control cells showed a decrease in the expression of a range of CI accessory subunits  Fig.  e  red dots . Conversely  CHCHD   WT expres  sing cells compared to control cells showed an increase in the expression of a range of CI subunits including NDUFS  as well as NDUFA  NDUFB  and NDUFB  which are considered to be CHCHD  substrates      Fig.  e  blue dots and Additional file  . Given this rela  tionship between CHCHD  and CI biology  we hypothe  sised that elevated expression of CHCHD  in tumour cells may render them more sensitive to respiratory chain OXPHOS inhibitors. Indeed  we found that CHCHD   WT expressing cells were significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by the CI inhibitor rote  none  IC     nM  GR     nM  compared to con  trol or mutant CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells  IC     nM  in normoxia  Fig.  a  and hypoxia  Additional file  a  while there was no significant differ  ence in the effects of sodium azide on growth across cell lines  Fig.  b and Additional file  b . As with sodium azide  Additional file  c  rotenone also blocked HIF  protein  Additional file  d . Together  our data show that the increased sensitivity of CHCHD   WT expressing cells to growth inhibition is specific to CI inhibition  rotenone  as opposed to CIV inhibition  sodium azide  and occurs irrespective of oxygen levels. a b                 Control CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   C A C A    L  a i x o m r o N n i e t a t c a l   U D O   l o r t n o C o t e v i t a l e r     n.s.                                 n i m   H p m   R A C E Time  min  Control CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   WT.cl  Glucose Oligo A  DG c                                 h   s v   h t w o r G e v i t a l e R Time  h  Control CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   C A C A    d             Control CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   WT.cl  CHCHD   C A C A    n a i d e M G D B N y t i s n e t n I e c n e c s e r o u l F Unstained  NBDG       Fig.   CHCHD  promotes basal and adaptive metabolic responses  and provides a proliferative advantage to tumour cells. a Graph shows intracellular L lactate levels from control U OS cells  CHCHD   WT expressing cells  WT.cl  WT.cl  and CHCHD   C A C A  expressing cells  expressed as the percentage of control cell levels  measured using a cellular lactate assay. n    . mean SD  n.s. not significant   p  lt   . . b Graph shows ECAR  mpH min  in cells described in a  incubated in glucose free media and measured using a seahorse respirometer.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   CI is a major source of mitochondrial ROS production  which can have profound effects on cellular viability through oxidative damage to lipids  proteins and nucleic acids  . Therefore next  we assessed mitochondrial ROS  superoxide  production using the ROS reporter MitoSOX. We found that basal ROS levels were similarly low in control and CHCHD   WT expressing cells  Fig.  ce . However  in response to rotenone  ROS levels were significantly increased in CHCHD   WT ex  pressing cells compared to control or CHCHD   C A  C A expressing cells  Fig.  c  d . Treatment of cells with sodium azide did not lead to a change in mitochon  drial ROS levels  Fig.  e . Thus  the increased sensitivity of CHCHD   WT expressing cells to CI inhibitors  rotenone  correlates with increased ROS production in these cells  suggesting that CHCHD  expression levels determines tumour cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. CHCHD  promotes mitochondrial ROS production in response to CI inhibitors To further explore the relationship between CHCHD  and CI biology  we evaluated the effects of CI inhibition in CHCHD   WT expressing cells using the small mol  ecule inhibitor BAY    . BAY   was pre  viously identified from a HIF reporter screen and was shown to block HIF  by targeting CI without inhibit  ing CIII  . BAY   exhibits potent antitumor ac  tivity in vivo   and has recently been shown to induce mitochondrial ROS through its CI inhibitory ac  tivity  . The IC   dose     nM  of BAY   for inhibiting whole CI enzyme activity  which was   fold less potent than rotenone in this assay  Fig.  a  also blocked basal OCR by      Additional file  a . Con  sistent with our findings with rotenone  Fig.  a  we found that CHCHD   WT expressing cells were signifi  cantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by BAY   treatment compared to control or mutant CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells in normoxia  Fig.  b  and hypoxia  Additional file  b . Notably  the increased sensitivity of CHCHD   WT expressing cells to BAY   was observed at very low nM doses  IC     nM  GR    . .  nM  compared to control or CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells  IC     nM   Fig.  b and Additional file  b  in normoxia and hypoxia. Interestingly  although we found that BAY   blocked whole CI enzyme activity by   at doses as low as   nM in vitro  Fig.  a  there was no sig  nificant change in basal cellular OCR  Additional file  a  or total cellular ATP levels  Additional file  c  at a   nM dose of BAY   treatment  suggesting that the ef  fect of CI inhibition on growth inhibition is not solely mediated by changes at the level of intracellular oxygen  ation or bioenergetics. Indeed  similar to our findings with rotenone  Fig.  c  d  ROS levels were significantly increased in CHCHD   WT expressing cells compared to control and CHCHD   C A C A expressing cells in response to BAY   treatment  even at a very low dose of   nM  Fig.  c  d . Addition of a ROS scaven  ger to rotenone treated cells has been shown to reduce ROS production and rescue cell death  . Here  we found that addition of the ROS scavenger Trolox signifi  cantly reduced ROS levels induced by BAY    Fig.  c  d  and rotenone  data not shown  and partially rescued the growth inhibitory effect of BAY   treatment in CHCHD   WT expressing cells  Fig.  e . To examine the growth inhibitory effects of BAY   treatment in the context of CHCHD  loss  we used U OS cells stably expressing either control shRNA or CHCHD  shRNA  Fig.  . We found that CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown led to significantly reduced tumour cell growth when cells were cultured in glucose free  galactose containing  media  Fig.  a  which forces them to utilise the respiratory chain and produce ATP via OXPHOS  . Importantly  we found that CHCHD   shRNA  knockdown cells were significantly less sensi  tive to BAY   treatment compared to control shRNA cells  Fig.  b . These data correlate with our findings for CHCHD   WT expressing cells  Fig.  e . Collectively  our data indicate that CHCHD  expression confers increased tumour cell sensitivity to mitochon  drial ROS produced by CI inhibitors. CHCHD mediated HIF  induction is blocked by NSC    without affecting the respiratory chain Previously  we have shown that CHCHD  regulates HIF  protein induction and HIF signalling in hypoxia and is required for tumour growth in vivo  . Here  we have found that elevated CHCHD  expression increases tumour cell growth rate  Fig.  c and Additional file  c  and HIF  protein levels  Additional file  c  d  in nor  moxia and hypoxia. Thus  next we assessed the contri  bution of HIF signalling to tumour cell growth rate observed in response to elevated CHCHD  without tar  geting the respiratory chain. To do this  we used a small molecule HIF pathway inhibitor that we previously identi  fied  named NSC   . Additional file  a shows our revised chemical structure for NSC   .

Moreover  in contrast to our growth inhibitor data observed with CI inhibitors  Fig.  a and Fig.  b  we found that NSC  showed a com  parable growth inhibitory profile  IC    . .  M  in Thomas et al.

Furthermore  we found that elevated HIF  and HIF  protein induced in CHCHD   WT expressing in normoxia and hypoxia was blocked by NSC   Fig.  f and Additional file  c . Collectively  our data show that our small molecule HIF signalling inhibitor  NSC  can significantly block CHCHD mediated HIF  protein induction without af  fecting the respiratory chain  highlighting the potential for targeting HIF signalling downstream of CHCHD  and out with the mitochondrial respiratory chain  Fig.  .  chunk section section heading Discussion  heading chunk Tumour cells rely on glycolysis and mitochondrial OXPHOS to survive  . Thus  mitochondrial metabol  ism has become an increasingly attractive area for inves  tigation and therapeutic exploitation in cancer  . OXPHOS inhibitors are coming to the forefront for use in specific cancer types  . However  given the import  ance of mitochondrial OXPHOS for controlling intracel  lular oxygenation required for normal physiological processes  delineating whether or how OXPHOS inhibi  tors might provide a therapeutic window in cancer is crucially important. Here  we provide evidence that CHCHD  expression in tumour cells is a critical determinant of the mito  chondrial expression of a broad range of respiratory chain subunits including individual subunits of CI  CII  CIII and CIV  some of which are known CHCHD  substrates  Table   Additional file   and  . These CHCHD regulated proteins contain both canonical  twin CX   C or CX   C  and non canonical  twin CX n C  cysteine motifs  suggesting that CHCHD  is capable of recognising and introducing disulfide bonds into pro  teins with a more diverse arrangement of cysteines than has previously been described  . In addition  we found changes in the mitochondrial expression of proteins pre  viously identified as Mia  substrates in yeast  e.g. CHCHD   Mrp  in yeast     Table  . Importantly  we found that increased expression of CHCHD  or CHCHD  knockdown increases or decreases respectively the expression of a number of supernumerary CI subunits involved in CI assembly  Table   and Additional file    . Our data concur with a previous study showing that targeted deletion of chchd  in mice results in embryonic lethality by day E .  with null embryos displaying severe deficiency in total CI expression  accompanied by less severe defects in total CII IV expression  . Interestingly  we identi  fied at least four accessory CI subunits that are known CHCHD  substrates  NDUFA  NDUFB  NDUFS  and NDUFB  Table  . Three of these accessory CI sub  units NDUFA  NDUFB    and NDUFS    have previously been identified as CHCHD  substrates with canonical twin CX   C motifs   while a fourth subunit NDUFB  contains a non canonical cysteine motif  CX   C CX   C   Table   and has been shown recently to be mutated in a single case of fatal infantile lactic acid  osis and cardiomyopathy in a way that renders it defect  ive in binding to CHCHD   . A previous study describing the systematic genetic deletion of each of the   CI accessory subunits in cells shows that loss of ei  ther NDUFA  NDUFB  NDUFS  or NDUFB  has detrimental effects on the expression of other CI sub  units  indicating that each of these CI subunits are strictly required for the assembly of whole CI  . Given the role of CHCHD  import within the IMS  it is par  ticularly interesting that these four accessory subunits of CI all reside within the IMS face of the CI structure    . Therefore  it seems likely that CHCHD  influences whole CI assembly and activity primarily through its ability to import multiple accessory CI subunits that are integrally involved in CI assembly  .

Tumour cells with elevated CHCHD  expression and increased CI subunit ex  pression and activity produced significant levels of mitochondrial ROS  superoxide  upon treatment with CI inhibitors. However  elevated CHCHD  expression did not render tumour cells more sensitive to growth inhibition by treatment with the CIV inhibitor sodium azide. CI and CIII are considered the major sites for mito  chondrial ROS  superoxide  production  . While we did not measure precisely where mitochondrial ROS  superoxide  was being produced upon CI inhibition in CHCHD   WT expressing cells  BAY   has been shown to block CI without inhibiting CIII   and was recently shown to induce mitochondrial ROS through its CI inhibitory activity  . Interestingly  a recent study has implicated HIF  in the induction of the CI subunit NDUFA L  as mechanism to prevent overproduction of ROS during hypoxia  . However  we found no change in NDUFA L  expression in response to increased  or decreased  CHCHD  expres  sion in our SILAC analyses. Metabolic adaptation to hypoxia in tumours is primar  ily mediated by HIFs and includes the diversion of glucose derived carbons from the TCA cycle and the conversion of pyruvate to lactate  and by upregulation of the enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase    PDK  and LDHA    . This reduces the reliance of cells on mitochondrial OXPHOS for the production of ATP  . Indeed  here and previously  we have shown that ele  vated expression of CHCHD  in tumour cells increases hypoxic production of cellular lactate  . Paradoxically  here we found that elevated CHCHD  expression in tumour cells leads to significantly reduced levels of cel  lular lactate in normoxia and no significant change in PDK   data not shown  which is consistent with an in  creased respiratory drive in these cells.

These observations indicate the possibility that CHCHD  expression confers a double advantage to proliferating tumour cells by stimulating more efficient glucose utilisation in both the presence and absence of oxygen. Consistent with this idea  we found that tumour cells with elevated CHCHD  expres  sion exhibit significantly increased proliferative capacity in normoxia and hypoxia  suggesting that CHCHD  is capable of promoting tumour cell growth and metabolic adaptive responses  potentially through increased re  spiratory drive and HIF mediated signalling respectively. Indeed  we found that our small molecule inhibitor of HIF signalling NSC      which exhibits anti tumour activity in vivo     could significantly block tumour cell growth and HIF   HIF  and HIF  protein in tumour cells expressing elevated CHCHD  without mitochondrial respiratory chain involvement.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk Mitochondria function as bioenergetic and biosynthetic factories to support cell survival and proliferation and are important regulators of intracellular oxygenation and responses to hypoxia  reviewed  . Our present study demonstrates that the mitochondrial protein CHCHD  controls the mitochondrial expression of a broad range of respiratory chain subunits. This reduces the glycolytic demands of cultured tumour cells and provides a prolif  erative advantage. However  our study also demonstrates that elevated CHCHD  expression renders tumour cells more sensitive to growth inhibition by CI inhibitors  in part by increasing ROS production. Furthermore  while elevated CHCHD  increases HIF  protein induction in hypoxia  this is also sensitive to respiratory chain inhib  ition. Respiratory chain OXPHOS inhibitors may offer a potential therapeutic route for the treatment of tumours with increased proliferative drive  but this comes with a significant risk of toxicity. Our study shows that our HIF pathway inhibitor NSC  potently inhibits the growth of tumour cells with elevated CHCHD  expres  sion  without influencing mitochondrial function or ROS production. Further exploration of the mechanism of ac  tion of NSC  will be particularly interesting. Additional files Additional file   CHCHD  siRNA and CHCHD  shRNA sequences.

Thus  mitochondrial OXPHOS has become an increasingly attractive area for therapeutic exploitation in cancer. However  mitochondria are required for intracellular oxygenation and normal physiological processes  and it remains unclear which mitochondrial molecular mechanisms might provide therapeutic benefit. Previously  we discovered that coiled coil helix coiled coil helix domain containing protein    CHCHD  is critical for regulating intracellular oxygenation and required for the cellular response to hypoxia  low oxygenation  in tumour cells through molecular mechanisms that we do not yet fully understand. Overexpression of CHCHD  in human cancers correlates with increased tumour progression and poor patient survival. Results  Here  we show that elevated CHCHD  expression provides a proliferative and metabolic advantage to tumour cells in normoxia and hypoxia. Using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture  SILAC  and analysis of the whole mitochondrial proteome  we show that CHCHD  dynamically affects the expression of a broad range of mitochondrial respiratory chain subunits from complex IV  including multiple subunits of complex I  CI  required for complex assembly that are essential for cell survival. We found that loss of CHCHD  protects tumour cells from respiratory chain inhibition at CI  while elevated CHCHD  expression in tumour cells leads to significantly increased sensitivity to CI inhibition  in part through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species  ROS . Conclusions  Our study highlights an important role for CHCHD  in regulating tumour cell metabolism and reveals that CHCHD  confers metabolic vulnerabilities to tumour cells through its control of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and CI biology. ,791,14.753476611883691
186819, sec map section chunk R E S E A R C H Open Access Inflammation induced DNA methylation of DNA polymerase gamma alters the metabolic profile of colon tumors Ashley R. Maiuri     Hongde Li     Barry D. Stein     Jason M. Tennessen   and Heather M. OHagan    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Inflammation  metabolism  and epigenetic modulation are highly interconnected processes that can be altered during tumorigenesis. However  because of the complexity of these interactions  direct cause and effect during tumorigenesis have been difficult to prove. Previously  using a murine model of inflammation induced colon tumorigenesis  we determined that the promoter of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma  Polg  is DNA hypermethylated and silenced in inflammation induced tumors  but not in non inflammation induced  mock  tumors  suggesting that inflammation can induce silencing of Polg through promoting DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. Polg is the only mitochondrial DNA polymerase and mutations in Polg cause mitochondrial diseases in humans. Because of the role of mitochondria in metabolism  we hypothesized that silencing of Polg in inflammation induced tumors would result in these tumors having altered metabolism in comparison to mock tumors. Methods  Inflammation induced and mock colon tumors and colon epithelium from a mouse model of inflammation induced colon tumorigenesis were assayed for alterations in Polg expression  mitochondria  and metabolism. Organoids derived from these tissues were used to study the direct effect of loss of Polg on mitochondria and metabolism. Results  We demonstrate that inflammation induced tumors with reduced Polg expression have decreased mitochondrial DNA content and numbers of mitochondria compared to normal epithelium or mock tumors. Tumoroids derived from mock and inflammation induced tumors retained key characteristics of the original tumors. Inflammation induced tumoroids had increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion relative to mock tumoroids. shRNA mediated knockdown of Polg in mock tumoroids reduced mtDNA content  increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion  and made the tumoroids more resistant to oxidative stress. Conclusions  These results suggest that inflammation induced DNA methylation and silencing of Polg plays an important role in the tumorigenesis process by resulting in reduced mitochondria levels and altered metabolism. An enhanced understanding of how metabolism is altered in and drives inflammation induced tumorigenesis will provide potential therapeutic targets.

Furthermore  epigenetics and metabolism affect each other    . For example  epigenetic alterations  includ  ing DNA methylation and histone modification  can re  sult in heritable changes in expression of genes involved in metabolism without altering the DNA sequence of these genes. Additionally  alterations in metabolism can affect the availability of metabolites that act as cofactors or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes. Metabolism differs in cancer cells compared to normal cells with one of these changes being an increase in glycolysis  . This change in metabolism in cancer cells supports their higher proliferative rate and increased need to generate macromolecules for accelerated mi  tosis. One hallmark of increased glycolysis is an increase in glycolytic flux  which allows cancer cells to take up high levels of glucose even in the presence of physio  logical levels of ATP  . Mitochondria produce ATP through oxidative phos  phorylation  OXPHOS  and in the process generate reactive oxygen species  ROS  redox molecules  and me  tabolites. They can sense cellular stress and assist cells in adapting to the environment making them important to the function of both normal and cancer cells. Because of their multiple cellular functions  the role of mitochon  dria in carcinogenesis is complex and can vary between cancers. While some cancers depend on mitochondrial respiration  other cancers have dysregulated mitochon  dria resulting in less efficient OXPHOS  . DNA polymerase  POLG  is the only mitochondrial DNA polymerase and is involved in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA  mtDNA . Furthermore  POLG is the only DNA polymerase capable of maintaining mito  chondrial numbers  . POLG is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of the catalytic core encoded by the POLG gene and an accessory subunit encoded by POLG . Mutations in POLG result in reduced mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders in humans  . Experimentally reducing POLG expression levels results in decreased mtDNA levels  . Each mitochondrion contains mul  tiple copies of mtDNA  and the copy number changes in response to energy demands. Expression of POLG and mtDNA copy number are controlled during develop  ment with high energy consuming cells having a higher mtDNA copy number than lower energy cells  . DNA methylation of the promoter CpG island of POLG has been associated with reduced gene expression and decreased mtDNA copy number in highly proliferative versus terminally differentiated cells and several cancer cell lines    . While DNA hypermethylation of Polg in human colorectal cancer has not been specifically studied  data from The Cancer Genome Atlas  TCGA  suggests that some colorectal cancers have increased levels of Polg promoter DNA methylation  . Further  more  mutations in POLG have been found in human breast cancers and are associated with decreased mtDNA levels and decreased mitochondrial activity  .

Using this model  we have dem  onstrated that inflammation induced tumors have DNA hypermethylated regions relative to epithelium from mock infected mice  mock Min epithelium  that are not present in non inflammation induced tumors from mock infected mice  mock Min tumors   . Inflamed epithelium isolated from ETBF infected mice after the removal of tumors  ETBF Min epithelium  has an intermediate level of DNA hypermethylation at regions altered in ETBF Min tumors. Importantly  we demon  strated that the initiation of epigenetic changes is dependent on the mismatch repair protein MSH   MutS homolog   recruiting epigenetic proteins to sites of inflammation induced oxidative damage. Mice lacking MSH  in their intestinal epithelial cells  Msh  l l VCMin  are deficient in mismatch repair  and ETBF infection of these mice results in an increase in tumorigenesis that is localized to the same region of the colon as in Min mice  a mean of   distal colon tumors per mouse   . Interestingly  these tumors  ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  have very few regions with DNA hypermethyla  tion and their genome wide methylation profiles are more similar to mock Min tumors than ETBF Min tu  mors. Polg was one of the genes found to be specifically silenced through promoter CpG island DNA hyperme  thylation in inflammation induced tumors with wildtype MSH  and a lack of MSH  in intestinal epithelial cells prevented Polg methylation and loss of expression in inflammation induced tumors  . Because of POLGs role in mitochondrial function  we hypothesized that reduced expression of Polg would result in reduced mtDNA and altered metabolism in inflammation induced tumors as compared to non  inflammation induced tumors.

At room temperature  the samples were placed in three changes of   ethanol        of ethanol propylene oxide    propylene oxide  infiltrated first with       propyl  ene oxide Embed   resin  Electron Microscopy Sciences  Hatfield  PA  and then with three changes of   resin before polymerization at   C for   h. The polymerized blocks were sectioned at   nm thickness using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome. Sections were placed on  mesh copper grids. The grids were stained first with saturated uranyl acetate  washed with water  and then with lead citrate. The grids were viewed with a JEOL company JEM  transmission electron microscope and photographed using a Gatan   k   k model   MultiScan camera. A single tumor was imaged per condition with five images taken per sample by a blinded investigator. Metabolomic analysis Metabolomic analysis was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry  GC MS  as previ  ously described with slight modifications  . Namely      mg of distal colon epithelium or tumors were washed twice in ice cold PBS  then  metabolites were ex  tracted with   L of   cold methanol containing   g mL of succinic acid d  as an internal standard using the Omni Bead Ruptor   homogenizer  Omni International  and dried with a Speed Vac. Dried extracts were derivatized with O methoxylamine hydrochloride and N methyl N trimethylsilyltrifluorace  tamide containing   trimethylchlorosilane  respectively. Derivatized samples were analyzed in an Agilent   GC iMS equipment with a  m Phenomex ZB  MSi column with a  m long guard column. Raw data were normalized with the internal standard and tissue mass. Organoids Organoids were derived from mock distal colon epithe  lium  colonoids  or mock or inflammation induced Min colon tumors  tumoroids  as demonstrated previously and grown in basal growth media containing EGF  epi  dermal growth factor  Noggin  R Spondin  and Wnt a  colonoids  or EGF and Noggin  tumoroids     . shRNA mediated Polg knockdown was performed by dissociating tumoroids into single cells using TrypLE  plating in Matrigel and incubating in media containing polybrene plus nontarget  NT  or Polg concentrated lentivirus for   h. Then  the media were changed to normal tumoroid medium supplemented with   M Y . Forty eight hours later  media were replaced with fresh media containing   g ml puromycin. Knock  down organoids were passaged at least one time before performing downstream assays. Maiuri et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Proliferation assay Tumoroids were disassociated into single cells and   cells in   L Matrigel were plated per well of a  well plate. On the indicated day  tumoroids were lysed by homogenization in   L Lactate Assay Buffer  BioVi  sion . The DNA concentration of the lysate was then de  termined using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay  Invitrogen  which is highly selective for DNA over RNA. Readings were found to be proportional to but more sensitive than cell numbers  data not shown . A similarly treated well without any cells added was used as a blank for the readings. Total DNA content was calculated by multiply  ing the concentration of DNA by the total volume of buffer. Glucose uptake  glucose depletion  and lactate secretion Glucose uptake assays were performed using the Glu  cose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit  BioVision  with some modifications. After   days of growth  tumoroids were incubated in   L KRPH buffer   mM HEPES    mM KH   PO       mM MgSO       mM CaCl       mM NaCl   .  mM KCl  pH  .  for   min followed by the addition of   L of   mM  DG  deoxy D glucose  and an additional  min incubation. Washed tumoroids were then removed from the Matrigel by pipetting up and down in cold PBS and lysed in extraction buffer. A  DG P standard curve was performed during each ex  periment and used to calculate  DG uptake. As per the manufacturers recommendation  protein concentration  BCA  assays were performed on the same cell lysate from each sample that was used for the glucose uptake assay to determine the protein concentration  which was then used to normalize the  DG uptake. The same wells of tumoroids were used for glucose depletion and lactate secretion assays. Media were collected from each tumoroid well at the indicated day post plating and used immediately for the assays. Glucose levels were measured using   L media and the Glucose  HK  Assay Kit  Sigma Aldrich  following the manufacturers directions. Media from a similarly treated well without any cells added were used to determine the starting glucose levels. The glucose standard provided with the kit was used during each experiment to calcu  late glucose levels. Glucose depletion was calculated by subtracting the glucose levels in the media of a given well from the media from the no cells well. The concen  tration of DNA in each well was determined as in the Proliferation assay section and used to normalize the depleted glucose levels. To determine lactate levels  media were diluted   or   in lactate assay buffer and   L was assayed with the Lactate Colorimetric  Fluorometric Assay Kit  BioVision  following the manu  factures protocol. A L Lactate standard was assayed during each experiment and used to calculate lactate levels. Lactate levels were normalized to DNA concen  tration as above. For NT and Polg KD tumoroids  lactate levels in media of wells containing tumoroids were determined as above at day   post plating. Tumoroid viability Seventy two hours after the addition of PBS or  .  mM H   O   to the media of tumoroid cultures  the media were removed and   L of KRPH buffer was added plus MTT  dimethylthiazol yl diphenyltetrazo  lium bromide  to a final concentration of   g ml and incubated at   C for   h. Matrigel and MTT were solubilized as previously described  .

Additionally  we demonstrated that in mice lacking expression of the mismatch repair protein MSH  in their intestinal epithelium  the inflammation induced DNA hypermethylation and expression alterations in tumors were reduced as compared to ETBF Min tumors  . The CpG island containing promoter of Polg is one of regions specifically DNA hypermethylated in ETBF Min tumors. As POLG is the only mitochondrial DNA polymerase involved in the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA  and mitochondria play a critical role in tumorigenesis  tumor progression  and metabolic regulation  we decided to explore the association between the DNA methylation of Polg and tumor metabolism. Tumors can be macrodis  sected as early as   weeks post infection in our mouse model. Therefore  we assayed Polg DNA methylation in early tumors and epithelium from Min and Msh  l l VCMin mice as well as  week tumors and epithelium for compari  son. Four  and  week ETBF Min tumors had significantly higher levels of Polg DNA methylation than epithelium Maiuri et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   from mock infected mice  mock Min epithelium   Fig.  a . In contrast  ETBF Min epithelium and mock Min and ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors had increased Polg DNA methylation compared to mock Min epithelium   weeks post mock infection  but not at   weeks  and this increase in DNA methylation was still significantly less than the Polg methylation in ETBF Min tumors. No significant changes in Polg promoter methylation were detected in inflamed epithelium from Msh  l l VCMin mice  Fig.  a . Lack of DNA methylation in the CpG island containing promoter of Gapdh in all samples serves as a negative control. Promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation is known to be associated with reduced gene expression. Polg expression was decreased in   and  week ETBF Min tumors relative to mock and ETBF Min epithelium and mock Min and ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  Fig.  b . Confirming the relationship between DNA methylation and expression  Polg expression in  week ETBF Min tumors was less than  week ETBF Min tu  mors. Additionally  Polg expression was only decreased in ETBF epithelium and mock Min and ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors versus mock epithelium   weeks post infection when there is a corresponding increase in DNA methylation. There was a trend towards reduced expres  sion of Polg in ETBF Msh  l l VCMin epithelium   weeks post ETBF  but the change was not statistically significant  Fig.  b . Because reduced expression of Polg has been associ  ated with reduced mtDNA content   we assayed mtDNA content relative to genomic DNA content in the various tissue types. At   and   weeks post infection  ETBF Min tumors had significantly less mtDNA content than mock or ETBF Min epithelium or mock Min or ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  Fig.  c  d . mtDNA content in mock Min tumors was not significantly different from the mock epithelium at either time point. At   weeks post ETBF mtDNA content in ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors was slightly reduced depending on the locus examined  but was unchanged or in  creased at the  week time point  Fig.  d . mtDNA content in ETBF epithelium was also partially reduced at   weeks  but returned to normal levels at   weeks post ETBF. Altogether  these data demonstrate that inflammation induced tumors with Polg promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation have reduced Polg gene expression and mtDNA content. a c d             weeks   weeks b         weeks   weeks  .   .   .    relative polg expression mtDNA set  mtDNA set   .   .   .   .    relative mtDNA ApoB mtDNA set  mtDNA set   .   .   .   .    relative mtDNA ApoB Mock Min epithelium ETBF Min tumor Mock Min tumor Mock Msh l lVCMin epithelium ETBF Msh l lVCMin tumor ETBF Min epithelium ETBF Msh l lVCMin epithelium Polg Gapdh Polg Gapdh  .   .   .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Inflammation induced tumors with wildtype MSH  have fewer mitochondria Mitochondria have multiple copies of mtDNA  and the number can vary between cell types   suggesting that the decrease in mtDNA content in the ETBF tumors could be from decreased number of mtDNA copies per mitochondria or decreased numbers of total mitochon  dria in the tumors. Therefore  we used transmission electron microscopy  TEM  to image mitochondria in tumors from our mouse model. Because of size limita  tions of TEM  we used tissues from mice   weeks post infection when tumors are still relatively small. Since mitochondria can be relocalized inside cells in re  sponse to stress  it was important to use control tissue that was undergoing similar inflammation induced stress  . Therefore  ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors are the best comparison tissue for ETBF Min tumors. TEM images of ETBF Min tumors had fewer mitochondria than ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  .  versus  .  mito  chondria per image  respectively   Fig.  . There were no obvious structural differences in the mitochondria that were present between the two different tumor types. This finding suggests that reduced expression of Polg by inflammation induced DNA hypermethylation results in fewer mitochondria in tumors although some are still present and likely necessary for cell survival. Altered expression of metabolic genes and metabolite levels in inflammation induced tumors Altered mitochondrial function has been associated with increased aerobic glycolysis  . To determine the alterations in metabolic gene expression in ETBF Min tumors versus mock Min epithelium  we first used a PCR array for detecting expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism as well as screened additional candi  dates by qPCR. Using a two fold cutoff  three genes on the array had increased expression in inflammation induced tumors  Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase  Like   Prps l  Hexokinase     Hk  Glycogen phosphorylase  muscle associated   Pygm  and   genes had decreased expression on the PCR array  Additional file   Table S . We verified expression alterations of genes with the greatest fold change  Glucokinase Gck  Aldolase  fructose bisphosphate B Aldob  Prps l  Hk  by qRT PCR  and all expression changes were validated  Fig.  a and Additional file   Figure S A . To determine which gene expression changes may be associated with re  duced expression of Polg and reduced mitochondria  we also performed qRT PCR using mock Min tumors and ETBF induced Msh  l l VCMin tumors  which have higher levels of Polg expression and mtDNA content than ETBF Min tumors. Hif a  Hypoxia inducible factor   alpha  Glut   glucose transporter   and Hk  had increased expression in ETBF Min tumors relative to mock Min epithelium as well as relative to mock Min and ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  Fig.  a . None of these genes had significant increases in expression in the other tumor types relative to mock Min epithelium. Hif a expression was also increased in mock Msh  l l VCMin epithelium and ETBF epithelium from Min and Msh  l l VCMin mice rela  tive to mock Min epithelium. Expression of  phophofruc  tose kinas fructose biphosphatase    Pfkfb  the only isoform of Pfkb that is induced by inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia  was significantly increased in all tumors assayed relative to mock Min epithelium and was signifi  cantly higher in ETBF Min tumors than mock Min or ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors  Fig.  a . Pfkfb  expression was not altered in ETBF epithelium from either genotype. Gck expression was reduced in all tumor types  but was significantly lower in ETBF Min tumors compared to the other tumor types  Fig.  a . Gck expression was also de  creased in ETBF Msh  l l VCMin epithelium. Interestingly  all of the expression changes in ETBF Min tumors are as  sociated with increased glycolytic flux    . Stabilization Fig.   Inflammation induced tumors with wildtype MSH  have fewer mitochondria.

However  by western blot  total HIF  and phosphorylated AKT were elevated to similar levels in ETBF and mock Min tumors relative to mock Min epithe  lium  Additional file   Figure S B . To more directly determine if the inflammation induced tumors have altered metabolism  we assayed metabolite levels in epithelium and tumors. We focused on inflammation induced tumors from Min and Msh  l l VCMin mice because these tumors were undergoing similar inflammation induced stress but had different Polg and mtDNA levels. While there was no change in glucose levels  the levels of glucose phosphate  G P  were higher in ETBF Min tumors than mock Min epithelium  Fig.  b . G P levels in ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors were unaltered relative to mock Msh  l l VCMin epithelium. Pyruvate levels were increased similarly in ETBF Min and Msh  l l VCMin tumors relative to their respective epithelium  Fig.  b . Lactate and the tricarboxylic acid  TCA  metabolites  citrate  fumarate  succinate  malate  were elevated in both tumor types relative to their respective epithe  lium  Fig.  b . However  levels of these metabolites were significantly higher in ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors relative to ETBF Min tumors. Altogether  these data suggest that both types of tumors have al  tered metabolite levels relative to their respective mock epithelium  but that ETBF Min tumors have in  creased G P and lower mitochondrial metabolites than ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumors. Tumoroids derived from inflammation induced tumors have increased glucose uptake The increased expression of genes related to glycolytic flux as well as increased G P metabolite levels suggest that inflammation induced tumors have increased glu  cose uptake. To be able to directly assay glucose uptake in tumor cells  we derived organoids from tumors from mock or ETBF infected Min mice  tumoroids  as well as organoids from mock colon epithelium  colonoids . Since tumoroids and colonoids only consist of tumor or epithelial cells  respectively  they provide a reductionist approach to examining cellular changes without other cells that are normally present in the mucosal layer of the colon  . Colonoids formed characteristic budding structures  whereas mock and ETBF tumoroids formed cystic structures that were similar in appearance to each other  Fig.  a . ETBF tumoroids proliferated significantly faster than mock tumoroids as demonstrated by in  creased DNA content per well of tumoroids at days     and   post plating for ETBF relative to mock tumoroids  Fig.  b . We verified that ETBF tumoroids maintain re  duced Polg expression relative to colonoids and mock tumoroids  Fig.  c . We then verified that ETBF tumor  oids have the increased Polg promoter CpG island methylation present in ETBF Min tumors by perform  ing qMSP on isolated DNA. ETBF tumoroids did have higher levels of DNA methylation at the Polg promoter than colonoids and mock tumoroids  but not at the Gapdh promoter  which does not undergo inflammation induced DNA hypermethylation  Fig.  d . Furthermore  ETBF tumoroids had lower levels of mtDNA than colonoids and mock tumoroids consist  ent with our previous data  Fig.  e . Interestingly  ETBF tumoroids had increased glucose uptake relative to mock tumoroids  Fig.  f  measured   days after plating . To confirm these results by a different assay  glucose levels in the media that the tumoroids were growing in were measured and normalized to the a b                                     Hif a Glut  Hk  Gck PFKFB                  relative expression Mock Min epithelium ETBF Min tumor ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumor Mock Min tumor Mock Msh  l l VCMin epithelium ETBF Min epithelium ETBF Msh  ll VCMin epithelium                                     G l u c o s e G l u c o s e       p h o s p h a t e P y r u v a t e L a c t a t e C i t r a t e F u m a r a t e S u c c i n a t e M a l a t e         relative metabolite levels Mock Min epithelium Mock Msh  l l VCMin epithelium ETBF Msh  l l VCMin tumor ETBF Min tumor   Fig.   Inflammation induced tumors have altered metabolism. a Gene expression by qPCR relative to mock Min epithelium from indicated tissue   weeks post infection.

Since aerobic glycolysis results in increased produc  tion and secretion of lactate  we measured lactate levels in the media and normalized these values to DNA content. Lactate secretion by ETBF tumoroids was more than mock tumoroids at days     and   post plating  Fig.  h . Changes in glucose levels in the media were undetectable at   days post plating  and glucose and lactate levels were not different between the tumoroid types at   days post plating. These findings demonstrate that epigenetic changes persist in tumoroids and that tumoroids derived from inflammation induced tumors with reduced Polg ex  pression have increased proliferation  glucose uptake  and lactate secretion than mock tumoroids. Reduction of Polg expression increases glucose uptake and resistance to oxidative stress in mock tumoroids Tumors have many epigenetic and other types of alter  ations compared to normal epithelium. To determine if reduced Polg expression directly affects glucose uptake  we first knocked down Polg in colonoids derived from the epithelium of WT uninfected mice. shRNA knock  down of Polg resulted in decreased Polg expression and reduced mtDNA  Additional file   Figure S A amp B .

Polg KD tumoroids had significantly increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion relative to NT tumoroids  but less than ETBF tumoroids suggesting that  at least in part  the increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion in ETBF tumoroids is due to the pro  moter DNA methylation and reduced expression of Polg  Fig.  c  d . a b c f   g Polg Gapdh  .                    relative methylation  log       Polg  .   .   .   .  relative expression     Mock tumoroid ETBF tumoroid Colonoid d mtDNA  mtDNA   .   .   .   .  relative mtDNA ApoB Colonoid Mock tumoroid ETBF tumoroid         e Mock ETBF          DG P  pmol mg     tumoroids   h Colonoid Mock tumoroid ETBF tumoroid Colonoid Mock tumoroid ETBF tumoroid     tumoroids tumoroids            .   .   .   .   .   .  day DNA  g  Mock ETBF   tumoroids          .   .   .   .  day depleted glucose  g ng     Mock ETBF                             day lactate  nmol ng     Mock ETBF Fig.   Tumoroids derived from inflammation induced tumors have increased glucose uptake. a Representative images of colonoids derived from mock Min epithelium and tumoroids derived from mock or ETBF Min tumors   weeks post infection.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Mitochondria are major intracellular producers of reactive oxygen species  ROS  and are susceptible to oxidative damage  . They also play a key role in initi  ation and execution of apoptosis. Therefore  we hypoth  esized that tumoroids with fewer mitochondria would be more resistant to oxidative stress than those with normal levels. We determined that ETBF and Polg KD tumor  oids are more resistant to oxidative stress than NT KD tumoroids by measuring cell viability   h after mock or  .  mM hydrogen peroxide  H   O     treatment  Fig.  d . Altogether  these findings demonstrate that KD of Polg reduces mtDNA content in both colonoids and tumoroids and increases glucose uptake  lactate secre  tion  and resistance to oxidative stress specifically in tumoroids.  chunk section section heading Discussion  heading chunk It is well established that inflammation can induce silen  cing of genes by promoter CpG island DNA hyperme  thylation  and this methylation  if it occurs in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes  can participate in tumorigenesis  . Tumorigenesis can also be initiated by mechanisms independent of chronic inflammation. Whether inflammation driven DNA methylation events result in tumors that are phenotypically different from tumors whose formation is not directly from chronic in  flammation is not well understood. Here  we uniquely demonstrate that inflammation driven DNA methylation and gene silencing of Polg in murine colon tumors results in tumors with fewer mitochondria and altered metabolism in comparison to non inflammation induced tumors. Furthermore  tumoroids derived from these two types of tumors retain their DNA methylation  mitochon  dria  and metabolic differences. Using the tumoroids as a manipulatable system  we demonstrate that increased glu  cose uptake  lactate secretion  and resistance to oxidative stress in inflammation induced colon tumors are  at least in part  due to decreased Polg expression. Human colorectal cancer tissue has lower mtDNA copy number than surrounding normal tissue  and the copy number negatively correlates with disease progres  sion  . There is also evidence of alterations in mitochondrial function in the epithelium of patients with inflammatory bowel disease  a condition that increases risk for developing colon cancer  . However  in these studies  which use human primary samples  it is unclear if decreased mtDNA is directly involved in disease progres  sion or is a consequence of the disease itself. Here  we demonstrate that  in the setting of inflammation induced tumors  decreases in mtDNA copy and in numbers of mitochondria are directly associated with increased glu  cose uptake  lactate secretion  and resistance to oxidative stress. The cause effect relationship between glycolysis and cancer is controversial. Mitochondria produce ATP through OXPHOS and synthesize key molecules needed for cellular proliferation. Some level of functional mito  chondria and mtDNA is necessary for the survival of cancers cells  . However  dysfunction of mitochondria in tumor cells through mtDNA mutations and or reduc  tion in mtDNA copy number alters OXPHOS resulting in increased reliance on aerobic glycolysis  . Upregula  tion of glycolysis produces ATP to compensate for decreased ATP production by mitochondria. Glycolysis also provides intermediates for macromolecular biosyn  thesis and redox homeostasis  .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   suggest that alterations in mitochondrial functions have a role in initiating or sustaining some tumors  . The loss of Polg expression in our system directly results in reduced mitochondria and a shift towards increased gly  colysis. Importantly  the DNA methylation  reduced Polg expression  and decrease in number of mitochondria occur early in the tumorigenesis process  at the earliest time point when we can macroscopically detect tumors  and occur to some extent in all inflammation induced wildtype MSH  tumors  we have tested in our model. The strong selective pressure for this process suggests that it results in a survival benefit for cells that harbor DNA hypermethylation of the promoter of Polg. Mitochondria are the major producer of intracellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species  RNS . Damage of mitochondria and impairment of mitochondrial respira  tory function enhances ROS release into the cytoplasm  . Mitochondria also play a significant role in the in  duction of apoptosis  . While ROS can play a positive role in tumorigenesis  ROS levels above the antioxidant capability of the tumor cells are detrimental  . Having fewer mitochondria present in cells at sites of chronic inflammation would result in less mitochondrial damage and therefore potentially less intracellular ROS produc  tion and reduced induction of apoptosis. On the other hand  increased redox potential of ETBF Min tumors could account for the increased resistance to ROS. Even though glucose uptake is higher in ETBF than mock tumoroids  the levels of glucose in tumor tissues are not changed significantly suggesting that the additional glu  cose is rapidly metabolized. Only the upstream metabol  ite  G P  is higher in ETBF Min tumors. The levels of the TCA cycle intermediates and lactate are lower in ETBF Min tumors  and the levels of pyruvate are not changed. The glucose could be metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway rather than glycolysis  which would result in production of the reducing agent NADPH  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate   . However  we found no differences in NADPH or reduced glutathione  GSH  levels between different tumor or tumoroid types  data not shown . While the exact mechanism of increased resistance to ROS needs to be further elucidated  we demonstrate that tumoroids with reduced expression of Polg  and consequently fewer mitochondria  are more resistant to oxidative stress suggesting a possible mechanism for the selective advan  tage for epigenetic silencing of Polg during chronic inflammation induced tumorigenesis.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk Polg DNA methylation changes in inflammation induced colon tumors make them metabolically different from non inflammation induced tumors and more resistant to oxidative stress. Understanding the metabolic differences and the role epigenetics plays in establishing and main  taining these differences is important for developing strategies to best treat cancers in patients that are caused by different etiologies.

OHagan    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Inflammation  metabolism  and epigenetic modulation are highly interconnected processes that can be altered during tumorigenesis. However  because of the complexity of these interactions  direct cause and effect during tumorigenesis have been difficult to prove. Previously  using a murine model of inflammation induced colon tumorigenesis  we determined that the promoter of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma  Polg  is DNA hypermethylated and silenced in inflammation induced tumors  but not in non inflammation induced  mock  tumors  suggesting that inflammation can induce silencing of Polg through promoting DNA methylation during tumorigenesis. Polg is the only mitochondrial DNA polymerase and mutations in Polg cause mitochondrial diseases in humans. Because of the role of mitochondria in metabolism  we hypothesized that silencing of Polg in inflammation induced tumors would result in these tumors having altered metabolism in comparison to mock tumors. Methods  Inflammation induced and mock colon tumors and colon epithelium from a mouse model of inflammation induced colon tumorigenesis were assayed for alterations in Polg expression  mitochondria  and metabolism. Organoids derived from these tissues were used to study the direct effect of loss of Polg on mitochondria and metabolism. Results  We demonstrate that inflammation induced tumors with reduced Polg expression have decreased mitochondrial DNA content and numbers of mitochondria compared to normal epithelium or mock tumors. Tumoroids derived from mock and inflammation induced tumors retained key characteristics of the original tumors. Inflammation induced tumoroids had increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion relative to mock tumoroids. shRNA mediated knockdown of Polg in mock tumoroids reduced mtDNA content  increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion  and made the tumoroids more resistant to oxidative stress. Conclusions  These results suggest that inflammation induced DNA methylation and silencing of Polg plays an important role in the tumorigenesis process by resulting in reduced mitochondria levels and altered metabolism. An enhanced understanding of how metabolism is altered in and drives inflammation induced tumorigenesis will provide potential therapeutic targets. ,631,14.362916006339145

Doh     Jason T. Lee     Thomas G. Graeber     Robert Damoiseaux     Orian Shirihai   and Harvey R. Herschman    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Precision medicine therapies require identification of unique molecular cancer characteristics. Hexokinase  HK  activity has been proposed as a therapeutic target  however  different hexokinase isoforms have not been well characterized as alternative targets. While HK  is highly expressed in the majority of cancers  cancer subtypes with differential HK  and HK  expression have not been characterized for their sensitivities to HK  silencing. Methods  HK  and HK  expression in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset was analyzed. A doxycycline inducible shRNA silencing system was used to examine the effect of HK  knockdown in cultured cells and in xenograft models of HK  HK    and HK    HK    cancers. Glucose consumption and lactate production rates were measured to monitor HK activity in cell culture  and   F FDG PET CT was used to monitor HK activity in xenograft tumors. A high throughput screen was performed to search for synthetically lethal compounds in combination with HK  inhibition in HK  HK    liver cancer cells  and a combination therapy for liver cancers with this phenotype was developed. A metabolomic analysis was performed to examine changes in cellular energy levels and key metabolites in HK  HK    cells treated with this combination therapy. The CRISPR Cas  method was used to establish isogenic HK    HK    and HK  HK    cell lines to evaluate HK  HK    cancer cell sensitivity to the combination therapy. Results  Most tumors express both HK  and HK  and subsets of cancers from a wide variety of tissues of origin express only HK . Unlike HK    HK    cancers  HK  HK    cancers are sensitive to HK  silencing induced cytostasis. Synthetic lethality was achieved in HK  HK    liver cancer cells  by the combination of DPI  a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor  and HK  inhibition  in HK  HK    liver cancer cells. Perhexiline  a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor  further sensitizes HK  HK    liver cancer cells to the complex I HK targeted therapeutic combination. Although HK    HK    lung cancer H  cells are resistant to this therapeutic combination  isogenic HK  KO HK    cells are sensitive to this therapy. Conclusions  The HK  HK    cancer subsets exist among a wide variety of cancer types. Selective inhibition of the HK  HK    cancer cell specific energy production pathways  HK driven glycolysis  oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation  due to the unique presence of only the HK  isoform  appears promising to treat HK  HK    cancers. This therapeutic strategy will likely be tolerated by most normal tissues  where only HK  is expressed.

The recent Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval of Keytruda for treat  ment of a wide range of advanced cancers with the com  mon biomarkers microsatellite instability high  MSI H  or mismatch repair deficient  dMMR  illustrates this concept of phenotype genotype commonality  rather than tissue of origin  for a common therapeutic ap  proach to subclasses of cancers from tissues of varying origin  . Larotrectinib  which targets the rare tropomy  osin receptor kinase  TRK  fusion mutation  is another example of precision cancer medicine  larotrectinib has demonstrated efficacy in cancers from different tissues that share TRK fusion mutations  . FDA approval is currently being sought for the larotrectinib treatment of adult and pediatric TRK fusion cancers  based on molecular makeup rather than the tissue of origin  . Most cancers increase glycolysis  the Warburg effect  a metabolic event postulated to ensure sufficient supplies of energy  ATP  reducing equivalents  NADPH  and or biochemical building blocks for cell growth and proliferation  . However  because of the conserved nature of the glycolytic pathway in normal tissues  global systemic inhibition of glycolysis results in adverse effects that make this approach of limited value  selective inhib  ition of cancer driven glycolysis will be required for clin  ical cancer therapy. The hexokinase  HK  enzymes  encoded by four genes  HK  catalyze glucose phosphorylation  the first enzymatic step in glycolysis  . Most adult tissues use HK  for glycolysis. HK  is inhibited by physiological con  centrations of glucose. HK  also known as glucokinase  GCK  is expressed in hepatocytes  pancreatic  cells  and glucose sensing neurons. HK  is expressed primarily in embryonic tissues and in adult muscle and adipose tissues. In addition  HK  is expressed in a wide range of cancers   from tissues that normally express only HK . HK  gene deletion in adult mice does not significantly affect normal tissues  . Consequently  selective HK  inhibitors have recently been developed   under the assumption that targeted HK  inhibition will reduce progression of HK positive cancers and have minimal adverse effects. However  most previous studies on HK  in cancer did not examine the contribution of HK  to cancer glycolysis    . Cancer subtypes with differential HK HK  expression have not been characterized. In addition to enhanced glycolysis  other modes of energy generation are utilized to support biological pro  cesses in cancer cells  these alternative energy generating sources include oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation    . The availability and use of multi source energy generation alternatives suggests both the flexibility of cancer cells in reprogramming their required energy generation under metabolic stress and their abilities to escape from alternative modes of energy generation blockade using monotherapies. Combination therapies that target compensatory energy metabolism pathways in cancer cells  but are tolerated by normal tissues  have not yet achieved clinical success  due to the conserved nature of energy metabolism shared by most cancer and normal cells. We have developed a combination therapy specifically effective in cancers with the HK  HK    molecular signa  ture  a subset of cancers which originate from a wide variety of tissues. Using an HK  HK    subpopulation of liver cancers as an example  we developed a synergistic combination of HK  inhibition and partial inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and fatty acid oxidation to achieve synthetic lethality of these HK  HK    tumors. However  like HK    cells tissues  HK    HK    cancers are not susceptible to this therapy  despite the reduction in their HK driven glycolytic activity. Our findings warrant optimization of the triple combination therapy as a preci  sion medicine for further clinical development to treat HK  HK    cancers  regardless of their tissues of origin.  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Cell lines and tissue samples Hep B  HepG  H  H  HT  HCT  SW  and Caco  cells were from the American Type Culture Collection  ATCC .

Unlike most adult tissues  which express HK  to drive glycolysis  the liver expresses HK   also known as glucokinase  and does not express either HK  or HK   Fig.  a . Liver cancers  however  no longer express HK  instead  analysis of datasets of liver cancer samples     revealed that  like many other cancers  HK  is expressed in many liver tumors  Fig.  b . Moreover  analysis of HK  and HK  expression in the TCGA liver cancer dataset demonstrates that a substantial portion   of HK     HK  RSEM  gt    liver cancers are defi  cient in HK  expression  HK  RSEM  lt     Fig.  c . Because tumor biopsies are likely to have normal tis  sue contamination  it is not possible to evaluate tumors in the TCGA collection from other tissues of origins for tumor HK  and HK  expression  the presence of HK  derived from most normal tissues would distort the estimate of HK  tumor derived levels in tumor biopsies. In contrast  contamination with normal liver  which does not express either HK  or HK  would not affect the evalu  ation of HK  and HK  expression in liver tumor samples. Tumors of multiple origin contain HK  HK    and HK    HK    subsets To confirm and extend the observations regarding the presence of HK  HK    liver cancers and to determine whether HK  HK    subsets exist in cancers from other tissues of origin  we examined the frequencies of HK  HK    and HK    HK    subsets in established can  cer cell lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia  CCLE  collection  .

We chose to use liver cancer cell lines to investigate HK  as a therapeutic target because of  i  the substan  tial contributions of both HK  HK    and HK    HK    tumor cell lines to the liver CCLE population   ii  the lack of effective treatment for liver cancers  and  iii  the prediction of liver cancer as the third most lethal can  cer in the USA in the next decade  .

Metabolomic analysis also revealed that the pools of most metabolites of glycolysis and the TCA cycle  as well as nucleotide pools  were reduced in HK  HK    liver cancer cells treated with FDG DPI and were further decreased when PER was added into the combination  Fig.  d . These data suggest that global changes in cell metabolism  in association with or caused by energy inhibition  may contribute to the HK i DPI PER induced synthetic lethality in HK  HK    cancer cells. The shHK DPI PER combination suppresses established HK  HK    liver tumor progression in vivo We next compared the efficacy of the shHK DPI PER triple combination to the efficacy of the shHK DPI double combination in xenograft HK  HK    liver tu  mors. In each of the treatment groups  individual HK  HK    Hep B shHK  DOX mice were switched to the DOX containing diet when their tumor reached   mm    day   to induce HK  knockdown.

While PER alone showed no significant effects on tumor growth  Additional file   Figure S  PER significantly enhanced the potency of the shHK DPI combination in Hep B shHK  DOX tumor progression  Fig.  a  b . No significant change in body weight was detected among the different Hep B shHK  DOX xenograft groups  Fig.  c . While both the shHK    DPI and the shHK    DPI   PER treatments activated AMPK and suppressed the mTOR signaling cascade  only the shHK    DPI   PER treatment induced the appearance in xenograft tumors of the apop  tosis markers cleaved caspase  and cleaved caspase   Fig.  d . These data indicate that  with the reported maximum DPI tolerated dosage and schedule   the intratumor amount of DPI was not sufficient to achieve tumor synthetic lethality with HK  knock  down. However  the addition of PER sensitized Hep B tumors to the shHK DPI combination and induced tumor cell apoptosis. The potency of the shHK DPI PER combination was also examined with two additional HK  HK    liver tumor xenografts  Huh shHK  DOX and HepG shHK  DOX  Fig.  eg .

Discussion In this study  we describe a triple combination therapy for treatment of HK  HK    cancers that targets the HK  HK    cancer specific modes of energy generation  HK driven glycolysis  mitochondrial oxidative phos  phorylation  and fatty acid oxidation. Using HK  HK    liver cancer cells as an example  we illustrated that tar  geting each individual energy generation source is either cytostatic or has only a subtle effect on cell proliferation or tumor progression for HK  HK    liver cancer cells. While the majority of cancers including liver cancer  from many tissues of origin  express both HK  and HK  in many types of cancers  there exist subsets of HK  HK    tumors  i.e.  tumors that express only HK . The potential specificity of this therapy for this HK  HK    subclass  and the extension of this therapy across cancers from a broad range of tissues of origin  results from this common phenotype that makes them vulnerable to this combination therapy. Fig.   The shHK DPI PER combination does not inhibit proliferation or tumor progression for HK    HK    cancer cells but is effective in inhibiting proliferation and progression for the isogenic HK  KO HK    cancer cells. a Effect of the shHK DPI PER combination on isogenic HK    HK    H WT shHK  DOX and H HK  KO  shHK  DOX cell proliferation.

Three representative xenograft tumors in each group in panel c were homogenized for Western blotting analyses of indicated proteins Xu et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   We have studied HK  knockdown in a large panel of naturally existing HK    HK    and HK  HK    cancer cells and found that only HK  HK    cancer cells but not HK    HK    cells as defined by mRNA and Western blot analyses are sensitive to HK  knockdown. It is likely that there is a threshold effect for HK  expression ne  cessary to provide resistance to HK  inhibition. Future studies in the titration of HK  protein levels using gen  etic manipulation approaches  such as inducible knock  down of HK  in HK    HK    cancer cells with different concentrations of doxycycline or inducible expression of HK  in HK  HK    cancer cells with different concen  trations of doxycycline  would quantify the threshold ef  fect of HK  required to provide resistance to HK  inhibition in cancer cells. In addition  how the HK  gene is silenced in the HK  HK    subsets of cancers is un  known. Future studies in regulation of HK  expression in cancers and in normal tissues may provide targets for combination therapies in conjunction with HK  inhib  ition for cancer treatment. It is important to note that  even at the highest DPI concentration   nM  we used in cell culture experi  ments  which is relevant to the tolerated plasma concen  tration previously determined in mice   DPI inhibits only   of OXPHOS activity  Fig.  d . These data sug  gest that the residual OXPHOS system can still oxidize fuels provided by metabolic pathways such as pyruvate oxidation  glutamine catabolism  and FAO. When we partially inhibited HK driven glycolysis and OXPHOS in HK  HK    cancer cells  we observed that FAO was upregulated as indicated by ACC phosphorylation  Fig.  a  and disappearance of intracellular lipid droplets  Fig.  e . Therefore  we targeted FAO with the clinical FAO inhibitor PER. The addition of PER sensitized HK  HK    cancer cells to the combination of FDG and DPI  indicating that FAO plays an important role in providing fuels to the residual OXPHOS activity  among the different fuel providing pathways. Because cancer cells can flexibly reprogram their en  ergy generation   loss of HK  activity in HK  HK    cancer cells is only cytostatic  however  the combined inhibition of these three critical pathways involved in ATP production leads to a profound decrease in energy generation and to synthetic lethality for HK  HK    cancers. Identification stratification of patients with an HK  HK    cancer molecular characteristic will be essential for clinical translation of our combination therapy as a precision medicine for this tumor subtype in tumors of different origins. While our manuscript was in preparation for submis  sion  De Waal et al.   reported that cell proliferation and xenograft progression of HepG  and Huh  liver cancer cells  which are from the HK  HK    liver cancer subset we studied  Fig.  e  are restricted by shHK  DOX expression and that combination of shHK  DOX expres  sion and OXPHOS inhibition with metformin further suppressed Huh  xenograft progression. We also find shHK  DOX HK  inhibition plus OXPHOS inhibition  in our case with DPI  reduces  but does not completely suppress  xenograft tumor progression for Huh   Fig.  e  and Hep B  Fig.  a  HK  HK    liver cancer xenografts. We suggest inhibition of the third major pathway driving ATP production  fatty acid oxidation  would enhance in  hibition  by shHK  DOX   DPI metformin  of HK  HK    liver tumor xenograft growth and confirm this hypoth  esis for Hep B  Huh  and HepG  liver tumor xenograft growth  Fig.  a  e  and f  . De Waal et al.   emphasized that many liver cancers express HK  however  a substantial proportion of liver cancers express both HK  and HK  or only HK   Fig.  c . We find neither cell proliferation  Fig.  a  nor colony for  mation  Fig.  b  are affected by shHK  DOX HK  inhibition for HK    HK    HLF and JHH  liver cancer cells  suggest  ing pharmacologic HK  inhibition will not have thera  peutic efficacy for HK    HK    liver cancers.

To determine whether HK  HK    can  cers of other origins will be sensitive to HK  inhibition  we created isogenic HK  HK    cells from HK    HK    H  lung cancer cells. As expected  xenograft pro  gression of HK    HK    H  cells was unaffected by shHK  DOX expression or the shHK  DOX  DPI PER com  bination  Fig.  c .

We conclude  i  that inhibition of HK driven glycolysis  OXPHOS  and FAO is likely to be a pan tumor precision therapy approach to HK  HK    tumors  regardless of their tissue of origin  and  ii  that cancer therapies that involve HK  inhibition will be restricted to tumors that do not express HK . In addition to the hexokinases  several isoform switches in other metabolic enzymes occur during hepatocarcino  genesis  e.g.  a splicing switch from ketohexokinase C  KHK C  to KHK A involved in fructose metabolism   and a switch from  HSD  to  HSD  involved in glucocorticoid metabolism and gluconeogenesis  . Although the mechanisms of these metabolic isozyme switches and possible relationships among these switches during hepatocarcinogenesis are not currently understood  these additional cancer specific isoforms may also be therapeutic targets for the development of effective cancer treatments. Tumor progression for HK  HK    liver cancer cells either by shHK  DOX   metformin   or by shHK  DOX   DPI  Fig.   is retarded but not completely suppressed. In vivo  DPI is maximally tolerated by mice at   mg kg  with a Xu et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   plasma C max value of   M  . The combination of shRNA HK  knockdown and daily DPI i.p. injection at   mg kg did not cause HK  HK    liver tumor cell apop  tosis  Fig.  d  suggesting that DPI at this dosage  in com  bination with HK  knockdown  is not sufficient to cause lethality of HK  HK    tumor cells in vivo. However  in  cluding PER in vivo to further sensitize HK  HK    cancer cells to the shHK DPI combination improved the thera  peutic effect on HK  HK    tumors from growth inhib  ition to tumor cell death. Targeting fatty acid oxidation has recently been attracting additional attention for cancer therapy      . ATP is the principal energy currency in cell meta  bolism and is a versatile regulator of cellular activities    . Maintenance of an adequate ATP supply is of crucial importance for cellular functions  for both nor  mal tissues and for cancers. Targeting HK mediated glycolysis  mitochondrial respiration  and fatty acid oxi  dation in liver HK  HK    cancer cells results in a syner  gistic decrease in cancer energy ATP production. While a substantial drop in cellular energy levels causes HK  HK    cancer cell death  the inhibition of different ATP generation sources may also have a profound im  pact on the distribution of compartmentalized intracel  lular ATP concentrations  ATP inhomogeneity   . For example  ATP produced from glycolysis is readily dif  fused in the cytosol  whereas transfer of respiration derived ATP from mitochondrial to cytosol requires carrier proteins across mitochondrial membranes  . Nuclear ATP levels are compromised by inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production but not by inhibiting glycolysis  . The subcellular compartmentalization of ATP has important roles in multiple cellular activities  such as cell motility   muscle contraction   DNA repair   and chromatin remodeling  . Further study will be required to explore the impact of our combination therapy on the ATP inhomogeneity in HK  HK    cancer cells derived from alternative tissues and the consequent effects on cell viability. To translate our findings to clinical treatment for HK  HK    cancers  several steps will be required    shHK  DOX HK  inhibition needs to be replaced by a se  lective HK  inhibitor. GlaxoSmithKline recently reported their development of HK preferental inhibitors  .   DPI stood out among all screened compounds as the best synergistic partner with HK  knockdown in HK  HK    liver cancer cells. Although DPI has been extensively tested in pre clinical animal models     its safety in human subjects is not known. Clinical drugs with ETC targeting effects  such as metformin   and papa  verine   will need to be examined for their abilities to replace DPI in the combination therapy.   Doses  sche  dules  and routes of administration of the therapeutic agents involved in the triple combination will need optimization  the dosages in this study for xenograft tumor analyses were based on the previously reported single agent dosages in mouse studies    . Because of the synergistic effects  the required dosage of each agent for optimal combination therapy may well be lower than those used in these initial studies. Conclusions We identified the HK  HK    cancer subsets existing among a wide variety of cancer types. HK  is the only ac  tive HK isoform driving glycolysis in the HK  HK    sub  sets of cancers. The combination therapy we have developed specifically reduced the cellular ATP level in these HK  HK    cancer cells to a level incompatible with cell survival. In conclusion  we suggest that reduction of ATP levels to a level that will no longer support the sur  vival of HK  HK    cancer cells can be clinically exploited as a targeted  precision medicine for HK  HK    tumors  regardless of their tissue of origin.

Herschman    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Precision medicine therapies require identification of unique molecular cancer characteristics. Hexokinase  HK  activity has been proposed as a therapeutic target  however  different hexokinase isoforms have not been well characterized as alternative targets. While HK  is highly expressed in the majority of cancers  cancer subtypes with differential HK  and HK  expression have not been characterized for their sensitivities to HK  silencing. Methods  HK  and HK  expression in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset was analyzed. A doxycycline inducible shRNA silencing system was used to examine the effect of HK  knockdown in cultured cells and in xenograft models of HK  HK    and HK    HK    cancers. Glucose consumption and lactate production rates were measured to monitor HK activity in cell culture  and   F FDG PET CT was used to monitor HK activity in xenograft tumors. A high throughput screen was performed to search for synthetically lethal compounds in combination with HK  inhibition in HK  HK    liver cancer cells  and a combination therapy for liver cancers with this phenotype was developed. A metabolomic analysis was performed to examine changes in cellular energy levels and key metabolites in HK  HK    cells treated with this combination therapy. The CRISPR Cas  method was used to establish isogenic HK    HK    and HK  HK    cell lines to evaluate HK  HK    cancer cell sensitivity to the combination therapy. Results  Most tumors express both HK  and HK  and subsets of cancers from a wide variety of tissues of origin express only HK . Unlike HK    HK    cancers  HK  HK    cancers are sensitive to HK  silencing induced cytostasis. Synthetic lethality was achieved in HK  HK    liver cancer cells  by the combination of DPI  a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor  and HK  inhibition  in HK  HK    liver cancer cells. Perhexiline  a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor  further sensitizes HK  HK    liver cancer cells to the complex I HK targeted therapeutic combination. Although HK    HK    lung cancer H  cells are resistant to this therapeutic combination  isogenic HK  KO HK    cells are sensitive to this therapy. Conclusions  The HK  HK    cancer subsets exist among a wide variety of cancer types. Selective inhibition of the HK  HK    cancer cell specific energy production pathways  HK driven glycolysis  oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation  due to the unique presence of only the HK  isoform  appears promising to treat HK  HK    cancers. This therapeutic strategy will likely be tolerated by most normal tissues  where only HK  is expressed. ,765,15.090196078431372

Djuzenova     Christoph Otto   and Ulrike Kammerer    chunk section section heading Abstract  heading chunk Background  Ketogenic diets  KDs  or short term fasting are popular trends amongst supportive approaches for cancer patients. Beta hydroxybutyrate  OHB  is the main physiological ketone body  whose concentration can reach plasma levels of   mM during KDs or fasting. The impact of  OHB on the biology of tumor cells described so far is contradictory. Therefore  we investigated the effect of a physiological concentration of   mM  OHB on metabolism  proliferation  and viability of breast cancer  BC  cells in vitro. Methods  Seven different human BC cell lines  BT  BT  HBL  MCF  MDA MB   MDA MB   and T D  were cultured in medium with   mM glucose in the presence of   mM  OHB at mild hypoxia   oxygen  or normoxia   oxygen . Metabolic profiling was performed by quantification of the turnover of glucose  lactate  and  OHB and by Seahorse metabolic flux analysis. Expression of key enzymes of ketolysis as well as the main monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT  and the glucose transporter GLUT  was analyzed by RT qPCR and Western blotting. The effect of  OHB on short  and long term cell proliferation as well as chemo  and radiosensitivity were also analyzed. Results   OHB significantly changed the oxygen consumption rate  OCR  and extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  in BT  cells resulting in a more oxidative energetic phenotype. MCF  and MDA MB   cells had increased ECAR only in response to  OHB  while the other three cell types remained uninfluenced. All cells expressed MCT  and GLUT  thus being able to uptake the metabolites. The consumption of  OHB was not strongly linked to mRNA overexpression of key enzymes of ketolysis and did not correlate with lactate production and glucose consumption. Neither  OHB nor acetoacetate did interfere with proliferation. Further   OHB incubation did not modify the response of the tested BC cell lines to chemotherapy or radiation.

However   OHB failed to influence different biologic processes in these cells  e.g.  cell proliferation and the response to common breast cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus  we have no evidence that  OHB generally influences the biology of breast cancer cells in vitro. Keywords  Ketogenic diet   Hydroxybutyrate  Ketone bodies  Breast cancer  Seahorse  Metabolic profile  Chemotherapy  Ionizing radiation Background Breast cancer  BC  is one of the most common cancers and affects about one in eight women during their life  time  . In general  modern BC therapy includes differ  ent therapeutic approaches  such as surgical removal of the tumor  chemotherapy  radiation  and hormone ther  apy  . In addition to these conventional therapies  a large number of patients seek supportive therapies like specific diets to improve their outcome. The correlation between different types of diet and the incidence and progression of cancer is increasingly becoming the focus of research  . In this respect  avoiding carbohydrates to specifically starve cancer cells is the most popular trend amongst cancer diets. The rationale for this diet  ary regime is often based on the Warburg effect  which describes the preferential fermentation of glucose to lac  tate even under availability of sufficient oxygen    . Therefore  reducing carbohydrate intake and thus lower  ing blood glucose seems to be a promising strategy for cutting cancer off from glucose supply  . Besides fasting  the strictest form of such a very low carb diet is called the ketogenic diet  KD . The KD is characterized by consuming the predominant proportion of calories from fat  balancing those derived from protein and thus consuming very few calories from glucose or other carbohydrates. Different KD regimens were shown to be safe and well tolerated in a variety of malignancies   and lead to the metabolic state of a physiological ketosis  . During ketosis  the ketone bodies acetoace  tate  AcAc  and D hydroxybutyrate  R hydroxybuty  rate   OHB  are predominantly produced in the liver and can be detected in the peripheral blood and urine above normal levels  .  OHB is found at similar or higher concentrations than AcAc and therefore  considered the principal ketone body. In humans  the median concen  tration of  OHB in plasma reaches approximately   mM under short term fasting conditions   up to   mM dur  ing long term starvation   and regularly at least   mM under a ketogenic diet  .  OHB is transported into cells via monocarboxylic acid transporters  MCT . The isoforms MCT  MCT  and MCT  can transport lactate and ketone bodies across the cell membrane    . Here  MCT  has the highest affinity for  OHB  whereas MCT  and   have a higher affinity for lactate    . In mitochondria   OHB is degraded via ketolysis into acetyl CoA  which then is metabolized within the Krebs cycle and the re  spiratory chain to generate energy  . Since the oxidation of  OHB generates more energy per mol oxy  gen used compared to glucose  it is sometimes labeled a superfuel  . However  cells need functioning mito  chondria as well as sufficient oxygen supply to generate energy from  OHB. The latter is hampered in the hyp  oxic microenvironment of larger tumors  which has already been shown in vivo for breast cancer tissue in patients  . There are somewhat contradicting results regarding the effect of  OHB on growth and biology of tumor cells cultured in vitro and in experimental tumors in mice. In some studies  ketone bodies seem to be associ  ated with cancer progression  metastasis  and poor clin  ical outcome    . In contrast  it was shown that a ketogenic diet significantly reduces tumor growth in mice    . Further  an antiproliferative effect of  OHB was already shown for different cancer cells  such as glioblastoma and tumor stem cells   melan  oma  cervical carcinoma  or neuroblastoma  . Several studies also described a significant delay of tumor growth in mice and humans in a systemic ketosis            . In this respect  Rodrigues and coworkers reported evidence for a  hydroxybutyrate paradox  . They postulated that the effect of  OHB on cancer growth would depend on the tumors energetic phenotype. Thus  oxidative cells would use  OHB as an additional energy source so that tumors with predomin  antly oxidative cells increase their growth when this me  tabolite is available. Other cells with a more glycolytic  Warburg like phenotype would be unable to metabolize  OHB in which case it could accumulate intracellularly and inhibit tumor growth via signaling and epigenetic mechanisms  . In view of this preclinical pro  and contra evidence and the fact that increasing numbers of patients are adopting a ketogenic diet or short term fasting during oncological therapy  we studied the impact of  OHB on seven different BC cell lines in vitro. Here  we initially analyzed the energetic profile of these cells and corre  lated this to the effect of  OHB on cell proliferation. Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Further  we investigated the possibility of synergism be  tween ketosis and radio  or chemotherapy  . To mimic a physiological state of metabolites found in the circulation of patients performing a KD  we performed experiments with   mM  OHB  representing pro  nounced ketosis  and   mM glucose  typical for the blood glucose level found in persons on a KD  range  . .  mM     . Furthermore  we investigated cells at both an oxygen supply of   oxygen     kPA  a typical mean concentration between well vascularized benign breast tissue  .  kPA  and non hypoxic tumor regions  . .  kPA  in vivo   and   oxygen   kPA  as a common condition used in cell culture.  chunk section section heading Methods  heading chunk Breast cancer cell lines and culture The BC cell lines BT  BT  HBL  MCF  MDA MB   MDA MB   and T D were obtained from Cell Lines Service GmbH  CLS  Eppelheim  Germany  and their receptor status  subtype  and mutation status are summarized in Table    . The BT  and the MDA MB   cell lines were purchased directly from CLS for the experiments and used at low passage. All other cell lines were authenticated via genetic profiling of SRT loci by CLS before running the experiments. Aliquots of the cell lines were freshly cultured from frozen samples in  cm   cell culture flasks  TPP  Trasadingen  Switzerland  in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium  DMEM Hams F    medium  Gibco  ThermoFisher Scientific  Darm  stadt  Germany  supplemented with   fetal calf serum  FCS  Biochrom  Berlin  Germany  and   ng ml Gentamy  cin  Sigma Aldrich  Munich  Germany  in the presence of   CO   and   oxygen  respectively. Turnover of metabolites For quantification of glucose  lactate  and  OHB metab  olism  cells were seeded and cultured at conditions de  scribed in the cell proliferation assay.

The concen  trations of glucose and lactate were measured with the Cobas   modular analyzer series  Roche Diagnostics  Mannheim  Germany  at the central laboratory of the University Hospital of Wurzburg. Concentrations of me  tabolites were expressed in millimolar per optical density  OD  of crystal violet dye extracts in each well at day   or   of culture.

The Agilent Sea  horse XFe  Sensor Cartridge was hydrated with   l well of XF calibrant solution overnight in a non CO   incubator at   C. On the day of the experiment    ml of Seahorse assay medium containing   mM pyruvate    mM glutamine  and   mM glucose was prepared. The pH of the pre warmed   C  medium was adjusted to  .  with  .

Cells were washed twice with   l of the corresponding Seahorse medium and incubated in   l of the respective Seahorse medium per well in a non CO   incubator at   C for   h.

After the measurement  super  natant from the cells was removed and the cells were fixed by addition of   l methanol  Sigma Aldrich  for   min at RT and air dried. Subsequently  the cells were stained using crystal violet solution as described for the colony formation assay  see below . For quantification  stained plates were incubated with   l of   acetic acid per well with shaking for   min and the resulting solution was analyzed in a plate reader  Tecan GENios plus  Tecan Deutschland GmbH  Crailsheim  Germany  at   nm. Cell proliferation assay Adherent growing cells were seeded in  well flat bot  tom plates  TPP  at cell numbers determined for each cell line to reach semiconfluency after   days under the respective oxygen and low glucose conditions and to reach confluency after   days via preliminary testing. Thus    cells per well  depending on the cell line  were seeded in   l DMEM FCS Gentamycin    mM glucose. Cell plates were cultured for   days at   CO   and   C in humidified chambers at oxygen concentrations of   or   in hypoxia incubators  Coy Laboratories Products Inc.

At least   independent wells per cell line were tested either with or without   mM  OHB or  .  mM acetoacetate  lithium salt  and LiCl  both Sigma Aldrich  as control in parallel. Four independent experiments were performed with fresh cultured cell aliquots. At day   supernatants were removed for metabolite testing    l of fresh medium containing  bromo deoxyuridine  BrdU  were added for an  other   h  and cell proliferation rate was then analyzed by the BrdU test  Roche  Cell Proliferation ELISA  ac  cording to the manufacturers instructions.

Two independent experiments were performed with   replicate wells per condition   and   oxygen with and without  OHB  for each cell line.

For Western blotting  pellets of       tumor cells were lysed and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method   and Coomassie Brilliant Blue  Roti Quant  Roth  Karlsruhe  Germany  reagent.

After   days of cell culture  BrdU was added for the final   h of culture and the BrdU test per  formed as described above. For radiosensitivity testing  subconfluent monolayers of cells were irradiated in the culture plates filled with   l well with the corresponding growth medium with graded single doses   Gy  and then cultivated for   days at either   or   oxygen con  centration. Irradiation was performed using a   MV Siemens linear accelerator  Siemens  Concord  CA  USA  at a dose rate of   Gy min. Half of the medium was changed every   days.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of    OHB changes oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in BT  cells Seahorse analysis confirmed the metabolic phenotype found in the glucose consumption lactate production rate analysis. All cell lines except T D exhibited a more aerobic energetic cell type  corresponding to cells that divide but generate their energy predominantly from oxidative phosphorylation  OXPHOS   Fig.  a . This basal metabolic phenotype did not correlate with the reaction of these cells to  OHB  since  OHB significantly influenced the oxygen consump  tion rate  OCR  in BT  cells only. Here  OCR in  creased from  .   .  to  .   .  pmol min  mean SEM  p  lt   .  when cells were cultured in the presence of  OHB  Fig.  b  c . For all other cell lines  we found no evidence that  OHB influenced oxygen consumption  Fig.  c  left graph . In addition  the effect of  OHB on extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  was analyzed. In the case of BT  cells  ECAR significantly increased from  .   .  mpH  milli pH min to  .   .  mpH min  p  lt   .  with  OHB. An increase from  .   .  mpH min to  .   .  mpH min  p  lt   .  and from  .   .  mpH min to  .   .  mpH min  p  lt   .  was ob  served in MCF  and MDA MB   cells under the influence of  OHB  respectively  Fig.  c  right side . Thus in general  no direct correlation between the metabolic reaction to  OHB and the basal energetic phenotype of the cell lines was seen. Consumption of  OHB is not strongly linked to overexpression of ketolytic enzymes and does not correlate with the observed effects on metabolic phenotype To investigate whether BC cells were able to use  OHB as a substrate for intermediate metabolism  we next de  termined uptake rates thereof in the panel of breast can  cer cell lines. All cell lines depleted  OHB from the culture medium but the magnitude of depletion differed substantially between them  Fig.  a . Interestingly  we detected variable levels of mRNA expression for key en  zymes of ketolysis  namely  hydroxybutyrate dehydro  genase    BDH  succinyl CoA transferase  SCOT  and acetyl CoA acetyltransferase  ACAT  in the seven human breast cancer cell lines  Fig.  b . In BT  cells  which showed a relevant consumption of  OHB  Fig.  a  we detected high levels of mRNA for all three key enzymes. SCOT and ACAT  but not BDH  were overexpressed in HBL  cells  which showed reduced  OHB consumption compared to BT  cells. All other cell lines revealed low levels of mRNA expression for ketolytic enzymes with a moderate ACAT mRNA ex  pression in MDA MB   and T D cells. However  changes in mRNA expression levels of ketolytic enzymes in response to  OHB and reduced oxygen conditions varied between the tested BC cell lines. We observed an overall decrease in expression of all three enzymes in MCF  and MDA MB   cells with further decrease  MCF  or a moderate increase of BDH  and ACAT in the presence of  OHB. All enzymes were downregu  lated in HBL  and MCF  cells  but and only BDH  and ACAT in MDA MB   cells in response to low oxygen   oxygen . This regulation was not observed in BT  BT  MDA MB   and T D. In summary  the data show no strong correlation between mRNA overexpression and consumption of  OHB or oxygen concentration. Moreover  the extent of  OHB uptake was not linked with the extent of the Warburg effect in each cell line as shown in Fig.  a. There was also no significant difference in the concentration of  OHB remaining in the medium after incubation with cells at   or   oxygen  Fig.  a . By Western blot analysis  Fig.  c  we showed that MCT  the key transporter for  OHB into cells   was expressed highly by all seven cell lines. In par  ticular  MCT  expression was higher at mild hypoxia in the majority of cell lines. Therefore  the transport of  OHB across the plasma membrane seems not to be a limiting factor for  OHB consumption by BC cells. GLUT  as a key transporter for glucose into tumor cells was detected in all cell lines  and its expression was not influenced by  OHB  Fig.  c . Together  our results demonstrate that  OHB does not significantly change the expression of ketolytic enzymes or of the transporter molecules MCT  and GLUT . Nevertheless  BC cell lines show marked differences in their ability to deplete  OHB from the medium indicating that mRNA expres  sion patterns of ketolytic enzymes were not associated with consumption rate of  OHB. Short term and long term cell proliferation of breast cancer cells is not affected by incubation with  OHB To analyze whether  OHB can affect cancer cell prolif  eration independent of their metabolic phenotype  we incubated the BC cell lines with   mM glucose  with and without addition of   mM  OHB in the presence of   or   oxygen  respectively. Here  we found a slight re  duction  lt    in short term   days  proliferation fol  lowing  OHB treatment in BT  MCF  MDA MB   MDA MB   and T D cells at either oxygen concentration  while BT  and HBL  cells were not affected  Fig.  a . Since AcAc  the second ketone body which rises in circulation upon a ketogenic diet  was described to increase proliferation in BRAF V E melanoma cells   we performed cell proliferation as  says in the presence of this metabolite over   days in parallel to the  OHB experiments. As shown in the Additional file   there was no significant effect of AcAc Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   A B C Fig.    See legend on next page.  Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   on the proliferation rate of the BC cell lines tested. A slight increase in proliferation of BT  cells at   oxy  gen concentration did not reach statistical significance. Since AcAc was used as lithium salt  control experi  ments with LiCl at corresponding Li concentration were performed  but did not differ from the proliferation rates seen with Li free cell culture medium  not shown . To test the effect of   mM  OHB on long term pro  liferation  we performed a colony formation assay for at least   days of culture. Similar to the results of the short term proliferation assay  we found no significant differences in number and size of cell colonies between cultures treated with  OHB and control cultures. Of note  oxygen concentration influenced size and number of cell colonies of BT  HBL  and MDA MB   cells  Fig.  b .  OHB incubation does not influence the response of BC cells to chemotherapy or ionizing radiation We next addressed the question whether exposure to  OHB may affect the sensitivity of BC cells to different treatment modalities. We therefore exposed the BC cell lines to epirubicin  paclitaxel  or carboplatin  three che  motherapeutic agents commonly used in breast cancer treatment. Here  we did not find any significant influence of  OHB on the effect of these drugs on can  cer cell viability at either   or   oxygen  Fig.  a and Additional file  . The cumulative IC  of paclitaxel was  .   .  ng ml  mean SEM   control  versus  .   .  ng ml   mM  OHB  at   oxygen and  .   .  ng ml  control  versus  .   .  ng ml   mM  OHB  at   oxygen. The mean cumulative IC  of epirubicin was  .   .  ng ml in control cells versus  .   .  ng ml   mM  OHB  at   oxygen concen  tration and  .   .  ng ml  control  versus  .   .  ng ml   mM  OHB  at   oxygen concentration.

Representative results of the sensitivity tests are shown in Fig.  b  c. Further  we found that  OHB did not significantly sensitize BC cells to radiation at either   or   oxygen. Hypoxia per se  however  showed a tendency to confer a higher radio resistance to the tumor cells  Fig.  a   b  consistent with the known action of oxygen as a radio  sensitizer. Two representative examples of dose response curves are shown for the highest responders to radiation at both oxygen conditions in Fig.  cf. In analyzing the cell lines individually  however  a tendency to confer a higher radiosensitivity is seen for those tumor cells grown in  OHB at   oxygen in all but the MDA MB   cell lines  Additional file  .  chunk section section heading Discussion  heading chunk In this study  we have shown that beta hydroxybutyrate  OHB  the main ketone body found in the circulation after fasting or ketogenic diets  KDs  was able to change the energetic phenotype of BT  breast cancer cells when applied at physiological concentrations of   mM. However  this effect of  OHB on energy metabolism was not observed in any of the other BC cell lines inves  tigated herein. Moreover   OHB did not interfere with turnover of glucose and lactate and neither significantly affected short  and long term cancer cell proliferation  or their sensitivity to chemotherapy or ionizing radiation in any of the cell lines tested. This implies that  OHB at a physiological concentration of   mM seems to be inert in affecting energetic processes essential for prolif  eration or cell survival in the tested BC cell lines in vitro. In addition  we found that AcAc  the second ketone body elevated under a KD  also did not significantly in  fluence proliferation of any BC cell line measured over   days. While preclinical data have shown that AcAc promotes proliferation of BRAF V positive melan  oma cells   it is interesting that in a pilot study   it was a patient with BRAF V E positive BRAF inhibi  tor resistant melanoma who responded favorably to a KD  this highlights the limitations of translating preclin  ical study results to humans. This research was performed  since a possible influ  ence of  OHB on cancer growth has gained substantial interest over the past years. In particular  different regimes for KDs are currently investigated in several  See figure on previous page.

On the other hand  there are other publications describing a negative impact of keto  sis OHB on tumor cell growth in vitro and in mouse models        .

BT  HBL  and MDA MB   showed an overall reduced colony size at   oxygen concentration compared to   oxygen concentration Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   phenotypes differed somewhat from the results reported by Pelicano and coworkers   who found that triple negative breast cancer  TNBC  cell lines were in general characterized by a higher extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  and lower oxygen consumption rate  OCR  compared to hormone re  ceptor positive cell lines  . For the TNBC cell line BT  we found an energetic profile that was low in OCR and ECAR and was comparable to the hormone receptor positive T D cell line. Furthermore  the TNBC cell lines MDA MB   and MDA MB   showed very similar energetic pro  files in our experiments and those of Pelicano and colleagues. However  in the study of Pelicano and colleagues  both MDA MB cell lines were very similar to the energetic phenotype of BT  cells. In contrast  in our study  the BT  cells showed a relatively low basal OCR compared to other TNBC cell lines in our experiments. This more oxidative basal phenotype of the TNBC cell line MDA MB   was recently also shown by Lanning and colleagues  even at high glucose conditions of   mM  . However  this study also described a low oxidative phenotype for the MDA MB   cell line which was remarkably lower than that of MDA MB   while in our investigation  both cell lines showed A B C Fig.   a The column graphs show the cumulative IC  of epirubicin  paclitaxel  and carboplatin in control cells  dark gray box  and cells cultured with   mM  OHB  light gray box .

The data were normalized to the corresponding values of non irradiated cells at   or   oxygen  respectively Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   comparable values of OCR. It is likely that these dis  crepancies between metabolic profiling data can arise from small differences in the culture conditions  for example different metabolite concentrations in fetal calf serum. Nevertheless  we can conclude that under the experimental conditions used here  only BT  cells shifted their metabolic profile upon exposure to reduced oxygen concentration. Those discrepancies between our and other metabolic profiling data could also be due to different expression profiles of the cell lines in different laboratories based on different sub  clones    . Of note  our quotient of OCR ECAR for BT  had a range from  . .   not shown  which is closer to the original findings of Warburg  who found that the quo  tient of respiration to aerobic glycolysis was  . .  in tumor tissue sections    . Apart from BT  the other BC cell lines remained relatively stable with respect to the OCR ECAR ratio in the presence of  OHB. We found that  OHB increases both basic OCR and maximal OCR after inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligo  mycin and in the presence of the uncoupling agent FCCP in BT  cells. This indicates that  OHB alters mitochondrial capacity  for example  by increasing the expression activity of respiratory complexes or by indu  cing mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition  glycolysis was also increased after  OHB exposure  indicating an overall increase in metabolic activity of these cells  as displayed in Fig.  a . However  this phenotype was not observed in the other breast cancer cell lines used in our study. One reason for this difference could be that BT  is the only TNBC cell line that is mutant for BRCA   Table  . Indeed  a large scale metabolomics study re  cently found that BT  cells differ in their metabolic profile compared to other TNBC cells  based on un  supervised hierarchical clustering  . While further ex  perimentation is required to identify the underlying mechanisms for the overall increase in metabolic activity caused by  OHB exposure in these cells  our data clearly show that  OHB does not affect the viability of BT  cells or their response to chemotherapy or radi  ation  despite this metabolic effect. Notably  ECAR is not only dependent on medium acidification via lactic acid but can also be affected by the production of car  bonic acid  H   CO     as an end product of the oxidative degradation of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid  TCA  cycle    . Here  a very important aspect is the observation that breast cancer cell lines  and espe  cially the TNBC cell lines  often use glutamine as a rele  vant nutrient to support their metabolic demands    . Moreover  glutamine can also be converted to pyru  vate and lactate by malic enzyme  . Since glutamine is not a limiting factor in our cell culture medium  we cannot exclude that the observed increase in ECAR is due to glutamine metabolism in the cell lines investi  gated. Therefore  the increase in ECAR in parallel to elevated OCR in BT  cells is likely to correspond to a generally more energetic phenotype of enhanced respiration and CO   or lactate induced acidification    . Another possible interpretation would be mitochon  drial uncoupling via overexpression of uncoupling pro  tein    UCP  that  although not evaluated in our study  has been shown to occur in BC cell lines  . UCP  overexpression has a metabolic action by supporting glu  cose and glutamine fermentation at the expense of mito  chondrial oxidation  . If mitochondrial uncoupling increased  then oxygen consumption would not strictly be linked to respiratory capacity. Anyway  the shift to a more energetic phenotype seems not to correlate with the metabolism of  OHB as an energy source. As proven by RT qPCR  the BT  cells express very low levels of mRNA for BDH  the key entry enzyme of ketolysis  and in line with this  consume only small amounts of  OHB. Of note  BT  cells also displayed the highest basal rate of glucose consumption and lactic acid production of all cell lines tested and this rate was not influenced by  OHB at physiological con  centrations. Further  the proliferation rate of BT  cells was unaffected by  OHB  similar to the other six cell lines tested. Here  we found no evidence that  OHB fuels the me  tabolism of BC cells in vitro. This is in accordance to an in vivo study  which showed that  OHB did not influ  ence growth of melanoma cells either when injected in  traperitoneally or when elevated by a high fat diet  . However  at the same time  it is in contrast to a previous study that has shown an increased growth of breast can  cer xenografts derived from MDA MB   cells when mice were injected with  OHB intraperitoneally  . In our in vitro experiments  the MDA MB   cell line showed no increased proliferation in the presence of  OHB. Moreover  no notable inhibition of proliferation by  OHB could be seen in our short term   days  and long term  at least   days  experiments  as described for other cell lines  . In this context  it should be noted that the growth inhibitory effects for  OHB pre  viously reported were predominantly seen with very high and non physiological concentrations of  OHB     mM  an observation we have seen in our cell lines as well  not shown . In detail  the first description of an an  tiproliferative effect of  OHB on different cancer cell lines was published by Magee et al. in  . The authors tested concentrations of  OHB between   and   mM  . In   Skinner et al. described an effect of  OHB on the viability of human neuroblastoma cells. Again  the authors used very high concentrations of  OHB between   and   mM  . Interestingly  an antiproliferative effect of  OHB was also described for a Bartmann et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   physiological concentration of   mM  OHB in brain tumor cells  but at a very high glucose concentration of   mM that represents a more pathophysiological ketoacidotic situation  . Our intent was to investi  gate the effect of  OHB in vitro under conditions more likely to be found in cancer patients on KDs. That is why we used physiological concentration of  OHB   mM  and glucose   mM   . Using cell culture conditions comparable to our experi  ments  Martuscelli described an antiproliferative effect of  OHB in glioblastoma cell lines and tumor stem cells with half maximal inhibitory concentration  IC  of   mM  OHB in the presence of low   mM  and physiological   mM  glucose concen  trations  . These contrary results described for the effect of  OHB on BC cells and glioma cells may re  flect differences in their ability to consume  OHB. Previous studies have shown variable gene expression levels of key enzymes involved in ketolytic metabolism in cancer cell lines of different entities    . In line with these data  we found different mRNA expres  sion patterns of ketolytic enzymes in BC cell lines. In BT  and HBL  mRNA transcripts for all ketolytic enzymes were detectable. This was associated with the highest relative consumption rate of  OHB by these cells. In contrast  the other BC cell lines failed to express increased levels of at least one of these key enzymes. This mRNA expression pattern was independent from the subtype of BC    Table   and not influenced by  OHB. In accordance to the results of Antalis and colleagues   we found very low mRNA transcripts for ACAT  for BDH  in MCF  cells  which was linked to their inability to consume  OHB. Altogether  the ex  pression of ketolytic enzymes on mRNA level seems not to be associated with the rate of  OHB consumption and unrelated to levels of glucose consumption and lac  tate production  however  we are aware  that mRNA ex  pression did not allow to judge about enzymatic activity. Cells take up ketone bodies by monocarboxylate trans  porters  MCTs  a family of proton linked plasma mem  brane transporters that carry ketone bodies across biological membranes. The most important transporter for  OHB into cancer cells is MCT      and previous studies describe an overexpression of MCT  in BC cells  . Here  we found a strong expression of MCT  in all seven BC cell lines  so that the absence of  OHB effects in the cells cannot be explained by defect  ive MCT expression. Since the expression of GLUT  was found to be related to poor prognosis in breast can  cer     we analyzed if its expression could be re  duced by  OHB. However  as for MCT  we could not detect any modulation of the GLUT  receptor expres  sion in dependency of  OHB  an observation also de  scribed in cardiomyocytes  . The KD is increasing in popularity  and an increasing number of cancer patients are trying the KD simultan  eously with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Recent clinical trials  e.g.  NCT  investigate safety and tolerance of a KD during combined chemotherapy and ra  diation. We analyzed the response of  OHB treated BC cells to chemotherapy and radiation in vitro. No signifi  cant changes in the dose response to three chemothera  peutical drugs most commonly used in BC treatment   were observed. Thus  the sensitizing effect of a ketogenic diet on radiochemotherapy in vivo   might be mediated by effects other than direct influences on cancer cells. In this context  the clinical study published by Klement and Sweeney   is of interest. The authors described an adequate tumor regression for a small cohort of cancer patients undergoing a KD and radiation therapy. Further  two mouse studies with glioma and lung cancer confirm the radio sensitizing effect of a ketogenic diet    . To date  no information is available on a pos  sible radio sensitizing effect of  OHB. Our in vitro results with   mM  OHB indicate a non significant tendency of this ketone body to sensitize most BC cells to ionizing radiation.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk The intent of the study was to investigate the effect of  OHB on seven BC cell lines in vitro under conditions likely to be found in patients on a KD or short term starvation. We have found strong evidence that a physiological concen  tration of   mM  OHB and AcAc did not impact cell prolif  eration and the response to standard BC chemotherapy and ionizing radiation is not changed by  OHB. These findings were independent from the diverse genetic background of the cell lines and differences in mRNA expression of ketoly  tic enzymes and  OHB uptake. Taken together  we found that  OHB at physiological concentrations has no major impact on BC cell proliferative behavior and the metabolic activity in vitro and especially does not fuel tumor cell growth. These results support clinical observations that physiologically increased  OHB serum concentrations in  duced either by a ketogenic diet or by short term starvation do neither support nor inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. Thus  a ketogenic diet should be safe for breast cancer pa  tients as already described for patients with diverse cancer types  for review  see  .

Beta hydroxybutyrate  OHB  is the main physiological ketone body  whose concentration can reach plasma levels of   mM during KDs or fasting. The impact of  OHB on the biology of tumor cells described so far is contradictory. Therefore  we investigated the effect of a physiological concentration of   mM  OHB on metabolism  proliferation  and viability of breast cancer  BC  cells in vitro. Methods  Seven different human BC cell lines  BT  BT  HBL  MCF  MDA MB   MDA MB   and T D  were cultured in medium with   mM glucose in the presence of   mM  OHB at mild hypoxia   oxygen  or normoxia   oxygen . Metabolic profiling was performed by quantification of the turnover of glucose  lactate  and  OHB and by Seahorse metabolic flux analysis. Expression of key enzymes of ketolysis as well as the main monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT  and the glucose transporter GLUT  was analyzed by RT qPCR and Western blotting. The effect of  OHB on short  and long term cell proliferation as well as chemo  and radiosensitivity were also analyzed. Results   OHB significantly changed the oxygen consumption rate  OCR  and extracellular acidification rate  ECAR  in BT  cells resulting in a more oxidative energetic phenotype. MCF  and MDA MB   cells had increased ECAR only in response to  OHB  while the other three cell types remained uninfluenced. All cells expressed MCT  and GLUT  thus being able to uptake the metabolites. The consumption of  OHB was not strongly linked to mRNA overexpression of key enzymes of ketolysis and did not correlate with lactate production and glucose consumption. Neither  OHB nor acetoacetate did interfere with proliferation. Further   OHB incubation did not modify the response of the tested BC cell lines to chemotherapy or radiation.

The theme was Powering the Cancer Machine  focusing on oncogenic signals that regulate metabolic rewiring and the adaptability of the metabolic network in response to stress. Keywords  Cancer metabolism  Metabolic stress  Metabolic signalling Opening session Isocitrate dehydrogenase  IDH  mutations are found in a variety of cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia. IDH  normally interconverts isocitrate and  ketoglutarate  KG . The mutant isoform  expressed in a subset of gliomas and acute myeloid leukaemias  instead converts isocitrate to the non degradable  hydroxyglutarate  HG . William Kaelin  Dana Farber Cancer Institute  showed that expression of the R H mutant IDH  drives growth factor independent proliferation of TF  leukaemia cells  which are otherwise dependent on GM CSF. He further demonstrated that  R HG  the enantiomer produced by the R H IDH mutant  could also support GM CSF  independent growth. It was found that  R HG and  S   HG differentially interact with a class of enzymes that use KG as a co factor  including JmjC  Tet  PHD and EglN family proteins  through which they elicit epigenetic alterations and affect hypoxia inducible factor  HIF  levels. The mTOR pathway represents a central cellular nutrient sensing hub  which controls many aspects of cellular metabolism. The tuberous sclerosis  TSC  tumour suppressor proteins  TSC  and TSC  are in  hibitors of mTOR activation. Michael Hall  University of Basel  showed that deletion of TSC  in the liver drives mTORC  hyperactivation  resulting in elevated secretion of FGF  a reduction in body temperature and reduced nocturnal activity. Treatment of mice with rapamycin lowered FGF  levels and restored normal body temperature and activity levels. These studies represent a novel observation that mTOR acti  vation could reduce body temperature  while previous studies have shown that mTOR inhibition by rapamy  cin could affect body size and prolong lifespan. David Sabatini  Whitehead Institute  MIT  who dis  covered mTOR while a graduate student with Solomon Snyder at Johns Hopkins  discussed cell autonomous regulation of TORC  and focused specifically on amino acid sensing by the TORC  pathway. In the presence of amino acids  TORC  is recruited to lysosomes via Rag GTPase heterodimers. However  neither the Rag proteins themselves nor their guanine nucleotide exchange factor  Ragulator  directly bind to amino acids. The amino acid sensing component of the pathway likely resides within the lysosome  where amino acids are concentrated up to millimolar levels. Metabolic signalling It has been documented that MYC drives the Warburg effect  which describes the propensity for cancer cells to import large amounts of glucose and excrete most of it as lactate. Lactate is transported through monocarboxyl  ate transporters  MCTs . John Cleveland  Moffitt Cancer Center  documented that MYC could directly induce the expression of MCT   SLC A  and discussed the therapeutic potential of MCT  inhibition in the context of MYC driven breast cancer and Burkitts lymphoma. MCT  inhibition suppresses activity of the lower half of the glycolytic pathway and glutathione production    Correspondence  Daniel.Murphy glasgow.ac.uk Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute  amp  Institute of Cancer Sciences  University of Glasgow  Garscube Estate  Switchback Road  Glasgow G   BD  UK Cancer  amp  Metabolism   Kamphorst and Murphy  licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

MCT  inhibition moreover suppresses the Cori cycle  through which lactate is removed from the circu  lation by the liver and used to drive gluconeogenesis. Treatment with the MCT  inhibitor thus lowers circu  lating glucose and lactate  suggesting an additional use for such agents to treat type II diabetes. The cells energetic state is continuously monitored by the AMP activated protein kinase AMPK  which re  sponds dynamically to changes in the ATP AMP ratio in order to suppress anabolism and promote catabolic ac  tivity  thereby maintaining energetic homeostasis. Daniel Murphy  University of Glasgow  spoke of exploiting this feedback mechanism as a strategy for targeting MYC in cancer. MYC accelerates ATP consumption  resulting in progressive activation of AMPK. Surprisingly  a related kinase ARK   aka NUAK  is required for efficient acti  vation of AMPK by MYC  and depletion of either is syn  thetically lethal with MYC overexpression. Inhibition of ARK  acutely perturbs mitochondrial respiration  and genetic experiments suggest that targeting ARK  may be effective against some forms of colorectal cancer. Reuben Shaw  Salk Institute  discussed an affinity trap strategy for isolation of physiological targets of AMPK using a SILAC approach adapted for use in vivo and noted that AMPK  double knockout cells also exhibit mitochondrial defects. Consistent with this observation  D. Grahame Hardie  University of Dundee  stressed that pro  motion of glycolysis by AMPK is an acute phenomenon whereas sustained activation promotes oxidative phosphor  ylation. As a negative regulator of TORC driven cell growth  AMPK is implicated in tumour suppression and may thus serve different roles at different stages of tumour development. Recent reports that AMPK can be activated by binding to ADP  as well as to AMP  were discussed as were arguments against a major contribution by ADP levels to AMPK regulation under physiological conditions. Owen Sansom  Beatson Institute  discussed perturba  tions to mTORC  signal transduction in APC deleted intestinal epithelium. Loss of APC leads to deregulated  catenin activity and consequently to elevation of MYC expression. In intestinal epithelium  this correlates with increased mTORC  activity  as evidenced by elevated levels of phospho S K and phospho E BP  and MYC deletion coincident with APC loss restores mTORC  activity to normal. Treatment of floxed APC mice with rapamycin reversibly prevents tumour progression in the intestine whereas mutation of KRas in combination with APC loss is associated with resistance to rapamycin. Increased protein translation in tumour cells generates its own limitations as cells struggle to maintain the required supply of amino acids. Brendan Manning  Harvard University  presented evidence that TORC  de  regulation simultaneously drives increased protein turnover as well as increased protein production and both effects are sensitive to rapamycin. Accordingly  cells with deregulated mTORC  are selectively sensitive to bortezomib mediated inhibition of the  S proteasome. SREBP  activation down  stream of TORC  drives NRF mediated coordinated tran  scription of proteasome subunits in a pre programmed adaptive response to anabolic stress. Macropinocytosis  a process associated with Ras mutation through which cells absorb nutrients in bulk  may reflect another mechanism to replenish amino acid levels. Dafna Bar Sagi  New York Langone Medical Center  described re  cent work on the role of macropinocytosis in tumour me  tabolism. Using a combination of microscopy and isotope tracing  it was found that macropinocytosis enables the consumption and degradation of extracellular protein to support metabolism. Various aspects of the significance of this novel mode of eating were discussed. In addition to its roles in driving increased protein translation and elongation  John Blenis  Weill Cornell Medical College  presented evidence that TORC  also regulates splicing efficiency. Downstream of TORC  re  cruitment of S K  but not S K  occurs to the exon junction complex via specific interaction with SKAR  polymerase delta interacting protein  . Recruitment of both factors is required for the efficient expression of intron containing pre mRNAs. Reactive Oxygen species  ROS  play a complex role in tumourigenesis being at once mutagenic and cytotoxic  depending on levels. Boudewijn Burgering  UMC  Utrecht  discussed direct sensing of ROS by Forkhead transcription factors via oxidation of cysteine residues  allowing the for  mation of stable intermolecular disulfide bridges between FOXO and other proteins  such as p . Treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide drives FOXO into the nucleus  activating a transcription programme to counteract ROS. Metabolic pathways and stress As reported earlier  HIFs play an important role in tumour progression. While in gliomas and leukaemias HIF levels are affected by  HG  in clear cell renal cell carcinoma  ccRCC  HIF  is stabilised by loss of function of the Von Hippel Lindau  VHL  protein. A newly discovered mechanism of HIF activation in ccRCC was presented by Celeste Simon  University of Pennsylvania  who discussed the role of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose bispho  sphatase    FBP . This enzyme is almost uniformly de  pleted in   ccRCC tumours examined. FBP  opposes aerobic glycolysis in renal tubular epithelial cells. Un  expectedly  FBP  was also found to inhibit nuclear HIF function in a non canonical fashion by interacting with its inhibitory domain. Loss of FBP  therefore may collaborate with the prominent VHL mutations in ccRCC to promote HIF activation and thus tumour growth. Kamphorst and Murphy Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  The metabolism of cancer cells is likely affected by the stressful conditions of the tumour microenvironment. Ralph DeBerardinis  University of Texas  Southwestern  therefore emphasised the need for protocols for in vivo isotope tracing. A case study was shown where human glioblastoma  GBM  patients were infused with   C glucose prior to excision of their tumour and analysis. Using this approach  it was found that in vivo  GBM tumours consistently had surprisingly high pyru  vate dehydrogenase and hence citric acid cycle activity  driving net production of glutamate. The enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase  PHGDH  catalyses the first step in the conversion of the glycolytic intermediate  phosphoglycerate to serine and glycine. PHGDH has been found to be amplified or overex  pressed in a variety of cancers  indicating the import  ance of these amino acids in cancer cell proliferation. While serine and glycine can be interconverted by serine hydromethyl transferases  SHMT   and   the relative importance of these amino acids in tumour growth remains unclear. Oliver Maddocks  Beatson Institute  showed that only serine rescued reduced proliferation of cancer cells in medium lacking both serine and glycine. This corroborated the finding that most cell lines avidly consume exogenous serine and only uptake glycine when serine depletes. Serine plays an important role in folate metabolism  supplying one  carbon units for purine nucleotide synthesis. Anne Brunet  Stanford University  discussed the meta  bolic regulation of aging using the C. elegans model. She focused on histone methylation as deficiencies in tri  methylation of histone   at lysine    H K me  were found to increase lifespan. Regulation of H K me  was also involved in lifespan determination. Brunet further discussed the importance of fat metabolism  in particular the different type of fatty acids  in H K me deficient worms and how this relates to longevity. Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway that can  depending on the context  have a tumour suppressing or tumour promoting role. Alec Kimmelman  Dana Farber Cancer Institute  explained how this role of autophagy in cancer depends on both the type and timing of genetic alterations that occur. Recent experiments in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer  PDAC  with oncogenic KRas and homozygous loss of Trp  showed that loss of autophagy accelerated tumour progression. Kimmelman showed that in a similar mouse model with instead sporadic LOH of Trp  tumour growth was dependent on autophagy. In this setting  autophagy may promote tumour progression by main  taining metabolic homeostasis during nutrient starva  tion. Kimmelman further described how specific cargo is targeted for selective autophagy. Nuclear receptor co  activator    NCOA  was found to be highly enriched in lysosomes where it acts as a selective cargo receptor for turnover of ferritin to sustain iron homeostasis. Daniel Peeper  Netherlands Cancer Institute  discussed a surprising role for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase    PDK  in suppressing oncogene induced senescence  OIS  in BRaf V E  driven melanoma. Pyruvate dehydro  genase is rate limiting for entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and contributes to maintenance of senescence in pre neoplastic nevi. Forced expression of PDK  inhibits PDH  bypasses OIS and thereby facilitates progression to melanoma. Importantly  suppression of PDK combines with paclitaxel to drive regression of established melanomas. Therapeutic opportunities Susan Critchlow  AstraZeneca  described efforts to tar  get MCTs. As reported above  MYC induces MCT  while HIF  could activate the expression of MCT . Given that the tumour microenvironment permits the commensal existence of hypoxic cells that export lactate and respiring cells that could import lactate for oxida  tion  inhibition of MCTs would be of therapeutic inter  est. Highly glycolytic tumour cells depend on these transporters to export rapidly produced lactate. Inhib  ition of MCT  with a novel small molecule  AZD  decreased the proliferation rate of Raji Burkitt lymph  oma cells  both in vitro and in vivo. These observations are consistent with the work of John Cleveland. Chi Van Dang  University of Pennsylvania  provided a background on the MYC oncogene and briefly discussed two recent publications from the Amati and Eilers groups in support of the case that MYC does indeed have specific transcriptional targets. He provided a con  ceptual framework for oncogene dependent nutrient addiction  reasoning that constitutive activation of growth factor independent cell growth and proliferation would render cancer cells addicted to nutrients to support deregulated growth. He also showed that MYC dependent transformation systems are dependent on both glucose and glutamine  hence causing MYC dependent cancers to be sensitive to inhibition of glycolytic and glutaminolytic enzymes. This was demonstrated by using lactate dehydrogenase A  LDHA  as an example. He further reported that survival in a transgenic model of MYC  dependent liver cancer could be prolonged by treatment with BPTES  an inhibitor of glutaminase. Pharmaceutical efforts to target mutant IDH already provide clinical proof of concept that acute myelogenous leukaemia could be treated in humans in phase I studies. Katharine Yen  Agios  showed that targeting mutant IDH can provide clinical benefit. Mutant IDH  drives  HG accumulation  leading to histone and DNA hyper  methylation  suppressing hematopoietic differentiation. Inhibitors of mutant IDH were able to reverse this Kamphorst and Murphy Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   http www.cancerandmetabolism.com content  hypermethylation and to induce differentiation in leu  kaemia models  resulting in significant survival benefit  in vivo. Although cancer cells have been shown to use glucose and glutamine  alternative nutrient sources are less well understood. Eyal Gottlieb  Beatson Institute  discussed the role of acetate metabolism in hypoxic cancer cells. Hypoxia limits production of acetyl CoA from glucose  which is largely converted to lactate through anaerobic glycolysis. By using siRNA screens  it was found that acetyl CoA synthetase    ACSS  which catalyses the production of acetyl CoA from acetate  was essential for cellular growth in hypoxic and nutrient stressed condi  tions. ACSS  is highly amplified in breast cancer  and further investigation confirmed the role of ACSS  in driving acetate consumption for fatty acid synthesis. Silencing of ACSS  suppresses cancer cell growth  both in vitro and in vivo. Thus  ACSS  could be an attractive therapeutic target.  chunk section section heading Conclusion  heading chunk The conference provided the audience a broad sampling of up to date knowledge and state of the art techno  logical developments.

However  the impact of obesity and weight control interventions on the therapeutic response in melanoma is poorly understood. Methods  High fat diet  HFD induced obese mouse model was used in this study to evaluate the outcome of dacarbazine  DTIC  therapy in melanoma. We employed LC MS MS to determine the quantity of the drug in tumor  and in various tissues. Unique in vitro approach was used to complement in vivo findings by culturing melanoma cells in either conditioned medium  CM  obtained from differentiated adipocytes or in serum collected from experimental mice. Results  We report that diet induced obesity impairs the outcome of DTIC therapy and reduces overall survival in tumor bearing mice. We provide evidence that obesity restricts the accessibility of DTIC to tumor tissue. Critically  upon curtailing adiposity  accumulation and efficacy of DTIC is significantly improved. Moreover  using appropriate in vitro approaches  we show that melanoma cells exhibit a drug resistant phenotype when cultured in serum collected from diet induced obese mice or in CM collected from  T L  adipocytes. The impaired therapeutic response to DTIC in obese state is mediated by fatty acid synthase  FASN  caveolin   Cav  and P glycoprotein  P gp . The response to DTIC and overall survival were improved upon employing weight control interventions in the tumor bearing HFD fed  obese  mice. Conclusions  This study indicates that obesity not only supports rapid melanoma progression but also impairs the outcome of chemotherapy  which can be improved upon employing weight control interventions. From clinically relevant point of view  our study exemplifies the importance of lifestyle interventions in the treatment of obesity promoted cancers.

Adiposity in overweight and obese people leads to dysregulation of adipocyte functions and associated pathogenesis. Poor survival of cancer pa  tients due to adiposity is an emerging  yet under explored  issue of clinical significance. Meta analysis of observational studies has established a strong relationship between devel  opment and progression of cancers including melanoma  with obesity  . Melanoma  a life threatening malig  nancy which arises in the vicinity of subcutaneous adipose tissue  accounts for the majority of skin cancer associated mortalities  . Obesity affects diagnosis and treatment because of its interference with medical imaging  lowering of tumor markers expression  alteration in the pharmaco  kinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs  compromised immune surveillance  improper precision of radiotherapy  and in  creased risk of surgical complications and recovery time  . In addition  tumor type and degree of adiposity add up to the complexity of therapy and further restrict the choices of chemotherapeutic drugs under obesity  .

Dacarbazine  DTIC  is the only US FDA approved cyto  toxic drug available for the treatment of metastatic melan  oma with overall response rate of mere    . Owing to its proximity to adipose tissue  under obesity  melanoma assumes aggravated lethality with accompanying drug resistance  which makes this association intriguing. However  administration of DTIC at doses based on weight or body size is a complicated medical issue which may have adverse effects  . In contrast  any discretion to decrease chemotherapy dose as in normal practice may lead to exposure of cancer cells to a non effective dosage of the drug that potentially contributes to drug resistance. There  fore  implications of strategy to control the proliferation and invasiveness of cancer in the background of obesity by containing adiposity need to be tested in a preclinical setup before being explored clinically. Previously  we reported that while diet induced obesity promotes melanoma growth   pharmacological and dietary interventions targeting obesity reverse it to a great extent  . Clinically  it has been proposed that a combin  ation of changes in lifestyle together with pharmacological approaches could be a more effective strategy for the man  agement of obesity promoted cancers  . In addition  unlike their relatively lean counterparts  the obese cancer patients require specific dosing for a curative response to treatment and overall survival  . On these lines  we hy  pothesized that weight control interventions in conjunction with cancer chemotherapy could have a significant positive impact on the management of obesity promoted cancers. By implicating pharmacological and dietary interventions to contain adiposity  we have explored the therapeutic outcome of DTIC in melanoma using appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. Methods Experimental animals and diets C BL J mice were procured from Experimental Animal Facility  EAF  at National Centre for Cell Science  NCCS  Pune  India. High fat diet   fat  was purchased from Provimi Animal Nutrition Pvt. Ltd.  Bangalore  India  and normal diet   fat  was obtained from Amrut Laboratory  Pune  India. The compositions of diets are provided in sup  plementary data  Additional file   Table S . Diet induced obesity was developed in the mice by feeding them with high fat diet as described previously    . Male C BL J mice   weeks old  were divided into normal diet  ND  and high fat diet  HFD  group. ND group was fed with nor  mal diet while HFD group was fed with high fat diet supple  mented with ground nut and dried coconut for   months. Body weight and serum chemistry profile were measured monthly to verify obesity associated changes. Water and food were provided ad libitum to all the mice. All animal experiments were carried out as per the requirement and guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals  CPCSEA  Govern  ment of India  and after obtaining permission of the Institu  tional Animal Ethics Committee  IAEC . Cells and culture conditions Murine melanoma cells B F  and B F  and murine pre adipocyte cells  T L  were procured from American Type Culture Collection  ATCC  Manassas  VA  USA  and maintained at our in house cell repository at National Centre for Cell Science  Pune  India. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium  DMEM  supplemented with   heat inactivated fetal bovine serum  Hyclone  UT  USA or Gibco  NY  USA  penicillin   U  ml  and streptomycin   g ml   Invitrogen Life Tech  nologies  CA  USA  and maintained at   C in a   CO   humidified incubator  Thermo Fisher Scientific  OH  USA . Serum biochemical analysis Blood glucose levels and serum lipids were estimated as described previously    . Insulin  leptin  and adiponec  tin levels in the serum were estimated by mouse specific re  spective ELISA kits as described  .

Orlistat treatment and or diet shifting in HFD mice  tumor challenge  DTIC administration  and follow up To study the impact of diet induced obesity on the outcome of DTIC therapy in melanoma  we treated B F  melan  oma isografted obese mice with DTIC purchased from Sigma  USA   mg kg intraperitoneally for five consecutive Malvi et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   days as described previously   . In addition  to look into the impact of weight loss interventions on the outcome of DTIC therapy in obese mice  mice were administered with orlistat  an antiobesity drug known to inhibit gastrointes  tinal lipases  and or shifted from high fat to normal diet followed by DTIC treatment. The detailed experimental plan is illustrated in Fig.  a. Briefly  obese mice were admin  istered orally with orlistat   mg kg on every alternate day  purchased from Enzo Life Sciences  NY  USA  and or shifted from high fat diet to normal diet. HFD C BL J mice treated with vehicle or orlistat were termed as HFD  HFD Ctrl and HFD HFD Orli  N     per each group  respectively  whereas HFD C BL J mice shifted to normal diet and treated with vehicle or orlistat were grouped as HFD ND Ctrl and HFD ND Orli  N     per each group  respectively. After   days  these mice were injected subcutaneously  s.c.  with B F  cells         in   l of PBS and monitored daily for the presence of palpable tu  mors and dimensions were recorded on alternate days. When tumor size became approximately   mm     all groups of mice were treated with vehicle  acidified water  or DTIC as mentioned above. Tumor volume was calcu  lated using the formula  .  length width   and was followed up throughout the study. At the end of the experi  ment  mice were sacrificed by CO   euthanasia. Excised tumors volume and weight were recorded  and the samples were immediately preserved at   C until further use. To observe their survival rates  five mice from each group were followed up for an additional   days. Orlistat treatment in ND mice  tumor challenge  DTIC administration  and follow up For investigating whether oral delivery of orlistat influ  ences DTIC treatment in melanoma bearing ND C BL   J mice  these mice were divided in to two major groups  N     per each group  ND mice treated with vehicle or orlistat   days prior to injecting melanoma cells were termed as  i  ND Ctrl and  ii  ND Orli  respectively. Mel  anoma cells were injected and orlistat treatment was con  tinued. Following tumor formation  all groups of mice were treated with vehicle  acidified water  or DTIC  and tumor volume was followed up in these mice throughout the study as mentioned above. The detailed experimental plan has been illustrated in Fig.  a  ii . At the end of the experiment  mice were sacrificed  tumors were excised  and the samples were immediately preserved at   C until further use. Five mice from each group were followed up for survival studies as mentioned above. Immunoblotting Melanoma tumor samples or cells were washed three to five times with ice cold PBS and lysed in ice cold RIPA lysis buffer as described previously  . Briefly  the samples were centrifuged at   RPM for   min and clear supernatants were stored at   C. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent  Thermo Scientific  IL  USA . Equal amounts of protein samples   g  were resolved on   SDS  polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto PVDF mem  brane  Millipore  MA  USA . The membranes were blocked and further probed with antibodies against caveolin   Cav    fatty acid synthase  FASN    pAkt  Ser    total Akt   PCNA   cyc  lin D     tubulin    Santa Cruz Biotechnol  ogy  CA  USA  and P glycoprotein  P gp     Abcam  MA  USA . After washing  the membranes were incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies   and blots were developed using luminescence detection re  agents  Santa Cruz Biotechnology  CA  USA . LC MS MS analysis and quantitation of DTIC in tissue extracts LC MS MS analysis was carried out on an Agilent   Infinity ultra high performance liquid chromatography  UHPLC  system coupled to an Agilent   UHD Accur  ate Mass Q TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a Dual AJS electrospray ionization  ESI  source.

Calibration curves were created using linear fitting   x weighting and including the origin. Calibration stan  dards  .  ng  were prepared using standard DTIC. All the samples including the standard DTIC preparations were spiked with leucine enkephalin   ng  as internal standard. Extracted ion chromatograms of DTIC  m z   .  and leucine enkephalin  m z   .  were applied for quanti  tation. The quantitation capability of this method is evalu  ated by using samples with known concentrations. Culture of melanoma cells in serum and conditioned medium Approximately  .

Among many  diet is one of the important factors that influence chemotherapeutic response in patients. Therefore  to investigate whether diet induced obesity or dietary interventions could dictate the outcome of chemo  therapy in melanoma  we developed diet induced obesity by chronic feeding of C BL J mice with high fat diet as described previously    . After developing diet induced obese phenotype  ectopic isografts were induced by inject  ing B F  cells as shown in the experimental layout in Fig.  a  i . Upon the appearance of palpable tumors  DTIC was administered in these mice and tumor volume and obesity associated parameters were regularly monitored. Parallely  similar experiment was performed in normal diet  fed  ND  mice  Fig.  a  ii . As expected  tumor progression was significantly reduced in ND mice treated with DTIC as compared to control  Fig.  b  i   ii . Additionally  DTIC treatment prolonged the survival of ND mice in compari  son to the untreated tumor bearing mice  Fig.  b  iii . Surprisingly  enhanced tumor growth in HFD mice treated with DTIC in comparison to their untreated counter parts at the same dosage was observed  Fig.  b  i   ii . In untreated HFD mice  overall survival was reduced when compared to their respective ND counter parts. Moreover  survival in HFD mice was reduced due to increased tumor burden under DTIC treatment  Fig.  c  iii . Further  to confirm whether DTIC treatment itself altered obesity  associated parameters in ND and HFD mice  serum chem  istry profiles were assessed. We found that DTIC per se did not affect the levels of obesity associated factors in ND and HFD mice as compared to their respective untreated controls  Table   and Additional file   Table S . These results indicate that diet induced obesity impairs the out  come of DTIC therapy in melanoma. Weight control interventions improve the efficacy of DTIC in obese mice In order to look into whether controlling adiposity has any influence on the tumor progression  HFD mice were sub  jected to weight loss interventions. We used both pharma  cological and diet control procedures as described in our previous study  . Following oral administration of orlistat   mg kg on every alternate day  and or shifting obese mice from high fat to normal diet  HFD to ND  on the  th day  B F  melanoma cells were injected. Subsequently  tumor progression and obesity associated parameters were regularly monitored till the termination of the experiment  Fig.  a  i . Similar experiments were also carried out in ND mice to further verify if orlistat  at an antiobesity dose  affects the efficacy of DTIC  Fig.  a  ii . Firstly  we monitored whether diet weight control inter  ventions alter obesity associated parameters. Normalization in the levels of obesity associated factors was observed upon orlistat treatment or by shifting experimental HFD mice to normal diet  Table  . Interestingly  in these mice  the levels of obesity associated factors were found to be close to the levels in ND mice  particularly when orlistat administration was combined with diet shifting  Table  . However  obesity  associated factors were unaffected in DTIC treated group as compared to respective untreated controls  Table  . Next  we checked if orlistat  at antiobesity dose  influenced the outcome of DTIC therapy in ND mice. Consistent with the results of our previously published study   tumor volume and weight were found to be unaltered in ND mice administered with antiobesity dose of orlistat  as compared to control mice  Fig.  b  i   ii . DTIC significantly decreased tumor volume and weight in ND mice. However  no further change in the tumor growth was observed in the mice receiv  ing orlistat and DTIC as compared to DTIC alone. Similarly  orlistat treatment did not influence overall survival of mice as compared to mice receiving only vehicle  Fig.  b  iiii . Also  no significant change in the overall survival was observed in mice receiving DTIC alone or mice receiving DTIC and orlistat together  Fig.  b  iiii . Thus  orlistat neither altered the tumor reducing effect of DTIC nor improved survival in ND mice. Moreover  levels of obesity associated factors were also not altered  Additional file   Table S  suggesting that orlistat per se does not influence the response to DTIC in ND mice. Interestingly  in tumor bearing HFD mice  we ob  served that weight control interventions by orlistat treatment or diet shifting not only restricted tumor growth but also im  proved the efficacy of DTIC  as is evident by reduction in tumor volume and weight  Fig.  c  i   ii  and survivability increased by    Fig.  c  iii . Furthermore  DTIC treatment was much more effective in retarding tumor growth and in improving overall survival when orlistat administration was combined with dietary intervention   survival at day   in case of orlistat treatment and   upon combining diet and orlistat   Fig.  c  iiii . Survivability of tumor bearing mice receiving orlistat and DTIC therapy or diet control together with orlistat and DTIC was prolonged up to   and   days  respectively  in comparison with   days for HFD mice receiving DTIC only. These observations were in parallel with normalization in obesity associated parameters in HFD mice  suggesting that reducing adiposity by weight loss interventions profoundly improves the efficacy of DTIC and increases overall survival of tumor bearing mice.

Evaluation of obesity associated factors in HFD C BL J mice. Obesity associated parameters in the experimental HFD mice recorded at the end of the experiment. HFD male C BL J mice were divided into two major groups. One group was continuously fed with HFD  whereas the other group was shifted from HFD to normal diet. Mice from both the groups were orally treated with orlistat   mg kg  or vehicle control on every alternate day for   weeks. All the groups of mice  N     per each group  were injected with B F  cells       cells mouse in   l PBS . After tumor formation  vehicle or DTIC treatment was given as per the experimental layout shown in Fig.  . Their body weight was monitored weekly throughout the study  and serum was collected at the end of the experiment. Blood glucose  serum TG  serum cholesterol  serum free fatty acids  and serum LDLc were measured. Serum factors including leptin  adiponectin  insulin  resistin  IL  and TNF  were estimated by ELISA. The results are given as means standard deviation Malvi et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Elevated levels of tumor promoting molecules and rapid efflux of DTIC contribute to impaired response To get mechanistic insights  we sought to explore the mo  lecular events contributing to impaired response to DTIC  in diet induced obesity. To understand as to why DTIC treatment leads to enhanced tumor growth in obese mice  we checked the levels of molecules involved in tumor pro  gression under obese state. Fatty acid synthase  FASN  is a key molecule associated with increased proliferation  sur  vival  and drug resistance in various cancer cells including melanoma. We have earlier reported that increased level of FASN and caveolin  Cav  contributes to the enhanced tumor growth in obese mice  . In the present study  we found that FASN level was further increased and Cav  levels was also elevated in tumors of HFD mice treated with DTIC  Fig.  a . On the contrary  as anticipated  FASN and Cav  level was much lower in ND mice treated with DTIC  Fig.  a . Additionally  to verify whether enhancement in the tumor growth is because of increase in proliferation of melanoma cells following DTIC treatment in obese mice  we checked the level of proliferative molecules. It was found that DTIC treatment caused increase in protein levels of cyclin D  and prolifer  ating cell nuclear antigen  PCNA  in tumors from HFD mice  Fig.  a . In contrast  reduced levels of these proteins were detected in tumors of ND mice treated with DTIC  Fig.  a . Changes in level of these molecules were associ  ated with concomitant alteration in the phosphorylation of Akt  an important kinase involved in cell growth  sur  vival  proliferation  and other vital cellular functions  .

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Furthermore  we explored the molecular events those might be involved in mediating impaired therapeutic out  come of DTIC under obese background. We speculated that  because of increased expression of P glycoprotein  P  gp  tumor cells are not able to retain sufficient quantity of DTIC. This would cause hindrance in the accumulation of an effective concentration of drug in cells. P gp is a multi  drug resistance protein associated with pumping out drugs from the resistant cells  . Therefore  we checked the level of P gp in the tumors of HFD mice administered with or without DTIC. Level of P gp  which was found to be elevated in tumors of HFD mice  was further increased in tumors from DTIC treated HFD mice. Under similar setup  DTIC treatment in ND mice reduced the level of P  gp  Fig.  a . Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the increased expression and localization of P gp to plasma membrane in B F  and B F  cells grown in HFD serum as compared to cells cultured in ND serum of C BL J mice  Fig.  b and Additional file   Figure S  respectively . To confirm the presence of DTIC in vivo  we checked the distribution of DTIC in tumors and other vital organs by mass spectrometry. We observed significantly reduced level  fold less  of DTIC in tumors excised from HFD mice as compared to the level in ND counterparts  Fig.  c . DTIC level in the plasma  liver  and adipose tissue from HFD mice was higher as compared to ND mice  Fig.  c . Concentration of DTIC was found to be even lesser in tumors than in other tissues excised from HFD mice  Fig.  c . Interestingly  obes  ity control interventions significantly improved accumulation of DTIC in tumors from HFD mice with concomitant de  crease in amount of DTIC in the plasma  liver  and adipose tissue  Fig.  c . Collectively  these results suggest that in  creased levels of FASN  Cav  and P gp in tumors are asso  ciated with increased tumor growth and impairment in the outcome of DTIC therapy in melanoma under obese state. FASN  Cav  and P gp are involved in impaired response of melanoma to DTIC treatment under obesity To corroborate in vivo findings in vitro  we cultured B F  cells in serum collected from ND and HFD C BL J mice. These cells were treated with varying con  centrations of DTIC. Similar to in vivo findings  we ob  served that B F  cells cultured in the medium containing HFD serum showed an impaired response to DTIC  Fig.  a  and inhibitory concentration  IC     of DTIC was significantly increased  fold more  as com  pared to B F  cells cultured in medium containing ND serum  Fig.  a . The IC   of DTIC   M  for cells cul  tured in medium containing ND serum was used for all in vitro experiments performed on cells cultured in serum collected from the experimental mice. Further  to verify the functional status of P gp in obese state  we performed rhodamine    Rh  efflux assays. In B F  and B F  cells cultured chronically in HFD serum  Rh  efflux was higher as compared to those cultured in ND serum  Fig.  b and Additional file   Figure S  respect  ively . Moreover  Rh  efflux was reduced in cells cul  tured in medium containing serum from orlistat treated and or diet shifted mice  Fig.  b and Additional file   Fig  ure S  which correlates with normalized serum levels of obesity associated factors. The increase in Rh  efflux in the cells grown in medium supplemented with HFD serum was reversed upon treatment with verapamil  an in  hibitor of P gp   Fig.  b and Additional file   Figure S  confirming the involvement P gp in the impaired response to DTIC in melanoma under obese state. Consistent with above stated findings  impairment in the response of B F  and B F  cells cultured in HFD serum condition to DTIC  in a long term survival assay was very clearly visible. In B F  and B F  cells cul  tured in medium containing serum from orlistat treated or diet shifted obese mice  cell survival was reduced by ap  proximately   and   respectively  upon DTIC treat  ment  Fig.  c  d and Additional file   Figure S . Survival was drastically reduced in the cells cultured in medium containing serum from orlistat treated or diet shifted obese mice upon treatment with DTIC  which was com  parable with the response to DTIC  in ND serum cultured cells  Fig.  c  d and Additional file   Figure S . Next  to ascertain the involvement of FASN  Cav  and P gp in the impaired response to DTIC in B F  cells cultured in the presence of serum from HFD and ND mice  long term clonogenic survival assay was performed in the presence or absence of inhibitors of these molecules. We observed that inhibition of these molecules individu  ally increased the cytotoxicity of DTIC in cells cultured in medium containing HFD serum. Moreover  sensitivity of B F  and B F  cells to DTIC was greatly increased  approximately   when all the three molecules were simultaneously inhibited  Fig.  c  d and Additional file   Figure S . Therefore  it is likely that FASN  Cav  and P  gp are cumulatively responsible for impairment in the out  come of chemotherapy in melanoma. Adipocyte secretory factors impair the response of melanoma to DTIC Above stated observations suggest that controlling obesity was associated with improved response to DTIC in obese mice  which in turn  implies an inter relationship between normalization in the obesity associated factors and cellular sensitivity. Melanoma cells grown in the serum collected from obese mice showed poor response to DTIC while re  verse was obtained for cells grown in the serum collected from either orlistat treated or diet shifted. Therefore  we speculated that poor response to the DTIC therapy in melanoma under obesity might be influenced by obesity  associated secretory factors. Thus  we explored the role of Malvi et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   adipocyte secreted factors towards the response of melan  oma cells to DTIC. To consolidate our observations  we uti  lized  T L  cells  which are considered as in vitro model for adipocyte secreted factors. For this   T L  cells were in  duced to differentiate in the presence or absence of orlistat  an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation  for   days  and the conditioned medium  CM  from these cells was col  lected. B F  cells were cultured in CM and treated with varying concentrations of DTIC. As expected  we noticed that B F  cells cultured in CM from differentiated adipo  cytes showed impairment in the response to DTIC  Fig.  a . Cells grown in the CM from differentiated adipocytes required much higher concentration  fold more  of drug to achieve   cell killing as compared to those grown in the CM of undifferentiated preadipocytes  Fig.  a  suggesting that adipocyte secretary factors indeed contribute towards poor response of melanoma cells to DTIC under obese state. IC   value of DTIC   M  for cells cultured in CM from undifferentiated preadipocytes was used for all the experiments involving melanoma cell culture. Further  to confirm the molecular events involved in im  paired response to DTIC  B F  and B F  cells were chronically grown in CM collected from undifferentiated  PA  and differentiated  ID   T L  cells for   days. Using immunofluorescence staining  we observed that the level of FASN  Cav  and P gp was increased in the cells cultured in CM from differentiated adipocytes in comparison to those cultured in CM from undifferentiated preadipocytes  Fig.  b and Additional file   Figure S . This suggests that altered levels of adipocyte secreted factors are involved in a c b d Fig.   Effect of obesity associated serum factors on survival of B F  cells upon DTIC treatment. a Calculation of IC   value of DTIC in DMEM containing ND or HFD serum.

To mechanistically analyze the involvement of adipocyte  secreted factors in modulating P gp expression and its func  tionality  Rh  efflux assay was performed. We observed that B F  cells grown chronically in the CM from differ  entiated adipocytes exhibited increased efflux of Rh  dye. In contrast  enhanced retention of Rh  was detected in B F  and B F  cells grown in CM from undifferenti  ated preadipocytes  Fig.  c and Additional file   Figure S . a d e c b Fig.   Adipocyte secreted factors impair the response of melanoma cells to DTIC. a Calculation of IC   value of DTIC in CM from  T L  cells.

Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   Thus  reduced uptake in B F  and B F  cells is likely a consequence of overexpression of P gp  which is responsible for the efflux of drugs from the cells. The involvement of P  gp was further confirmed by treating B F  and B F  cells cultured in CM from differentiated adipocytes with verapamil  which increased Rh  retention in this setting  Fig.  c and Additional file   Figure S . These findings suggest that P gp plays a crucial role in the impairment of chemotherapeutic response under obesity which is primarily mediated by adipocyte secreted factors. Differentiation of  T L  adipocytes is inhibited by orli  stat  which leads to reduction in the levels of adipocyte  secreted factors  . We sought to determine whether the diminished level of adipocyte secreted factors  under inhib  ition of adipocyte differentiation by orlistat  has any impli  cations in the response of B F  cells to DTIC. We also noticed that the rate of Rh  retention was increased in B F  cells cultured in CM from orlistat treated differen  tiating adipocytes  Fig.  c and Additional file   Figure S . Next  long term colony formation assay was performed to verify whether CM obtained from either preadipocytes or differentiated adipocytes could influence the survival of melanoma cells in presence of the drug. DTIC treatment did not remarkably affect the survival of B F  and B F  cells grown in CM collected from differentiated ID adipo  cytes  Fig.  d  e and Additional file   Figure S . The survival of B F  and B F  cells cultured in CM from orlistat treated differentiating adipocytes was reduced significantly to approximately   upon DTIC treatment  Fig.  d  e and Additional file   Figure S  suggesting that reduction in the level of secretory adipokines correlates with improved response to DTIC. Mechanistically  the sensitivity of B F  and B F  cells grown in CM collected from differentiated adipocytes to DTIC was in  creased upon inhibiting FASN  Cav  and P gp individually  Fig.  d  e and Additional file   Figure S . Sensitivity to DTIC improved dramatically  approximately   upon simultaneous treatment with all the three inhibitors  Fig.  d  e and Additional file   Figure S .  chunk section section heading Discussion  heading chunk In the present study  we report that diet induced obesity is associated with impaired response of melanoma to DTIC. Importantly  weight loss interventions can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of DTIC. As adiposity influences tumor progression  a combination treatment of obesity together with anticancer therapy is likely to improve survival  . Herein  we targeted adiposity and nutrient signaling together  to enhance the therapeutic ef  ficacy of DTIC. This study provides insights on reduction in obesity by orlistat and diet restriction improves sensitiv  ity of melanoma to DTIC  thereby prolonging survival. However  cachexia  a multifactorial wasting syndrome  characterized by the loss of adipose tissue and muscle  and severe weight loss are common in the advanced melanoma  and therefore  the adverse effects of obesity may be more important at relatively early stages of the disease. Use of orlistat as an antiobesity agent serves multiple purpose   i  an inhibitor of lipase and hence re  duction in absorption of fat by intestine    ii  reported to possess anticancer property   and  iii  as an inhibi  tor of differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes  . Our study provides a preclinical evidence that the out  come of DTIC treatment is impaired in obese mice. Sur  prisingly  DTIC treatment instead of restricting growth actually promotes rapid tumor growth in obese mice causing decreased overall survival of tumor bearing obese mice  as compared to untreated counterparts. This observation raises a serious question as to why DTIC treatment paradoxically promotes melanoma growth  and decreases overall survival under obese state. Earlier  it has been reported that chronic exposure of cisplatin to lung cancer cells enhances damage repair and tumor progression  . Moreover  Lev et al. have also shown that DTIC promotes rapid melanoma growth and metas  tasis by increasing the levels of IL VEGF    . Our results show that levels of P gp and other molecules involved in drug resistance such as FASN and Cav  are el  evated in tumor excised from obese mice treated or un  treated with DTIC as compared to mice kept on ND. Increase in the level of FASN and Cav  has been reported to be associated with development of resistance to cancer therapy  . Recently  we have shown that Akt medi  ates increased melanoma progression under obese state   and is also involved in regulating drug resistant pheno  type in several cancers  . Plasma membrane associated molecule P gp  which belongs to multidrug resistance  MDR  family of proteins  is involved in the efflux of drugs from cancer cells    . Importantly  there is a molecular link between FASN  Cav  and P gp signaling pathways which is regulated by adipokine driven Akt activation under obese state. We have previously reported that FASN and Cav  interact with each other and are regulated by adipokines  . FASN modulates Cav dependent signal  ing pathways and controls proliferation of cancer cells  . Since Cav  is a membrane protein and is reported to be associated with drug resistant phenotype  it is quite likely that it might directly or indirectly influence the activity of P gp. Owing to the enhanced activity of P gp  tumor cells accumulate very less amount of DTIC under obese state as compared to its lean counterparts. This leads to propor  tional increase in the level of DTIC in plasma and accumu  lation in other vital organs  Additional file   Figure S . Excess accumulation of DTIC in normal organs under obese state may contribute to toxicity and thus also affect overall survival. Our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that obesity  associated factors themselves promote drug resistant Malvi et al. Cancer  amp  Metabolism     Page   of   phenotype in cancer cells. Moreover  it has been reported that drug resistant cells are highly aggressive and grow rap  idly as compared to untreated counterparts  . There  fore  enhanced tumor growth owing to the DTIC treatment under obese state can be explained based on following pos  sibilities. First  due to the accumulation of low quantity of drug in cells under obese state  cancer cells can develop drug resistant phenotype which is typically more aggressive than untreated cells. Secondly  it has been reported that can  cer cells exhibit enhanced damage repair mechanism against DNA intercalating drugs  . Owing to the robust DNA re  pair mechanism  melanoma cells can also escape from the cytotoxic effect of drugs. DTIC induces cytotoxicity in can  cer cells by inducing DNA damage  which actually depends on the quantity of drug present in the nucleus. Put together  insufficient quantity of DTIC present in the cancer cells under obese condition coupled with the ability to rapidly clear DTIC DNA adduct might promote the development of aggressive phenotype. Moreover  chromosomal abnormal  ity due to abnormal repair mechanisms could also aggravate the melanoma growth. Yet another mechanism that could contribute to the rapid growth is enhanced secretion of IL VEGF by cancer cells in response to drugs    . Furthermore  activation of Akt signaling pathway and increased level of FASN and Cav  contribute to drug  resistant phenotype under obese state      . Therefore  it is likely that adipokine driven activation of signaling pathways and underexposure of drugs lead to development of highly aggressive melanoma pheno  type in obese mice. Epidemiological studies have shown that weight loss alleviates obesity associated complications and produces disproportionate benefit to health  . Data from observa  tional and calorie restriction studies in animal models sup  port a beneficial role for weight loss interventions in counteracting neoplasia promoting role of obesity    . Interestingly  by employing the strategy to control adiposity  we show that orlistat treatment or shifting from HFD to ND improves DTIC efficacy and increases overall survival of mice. And further  combining these two strategies together leads to improvement in the therapeutic outcome of DTIC and prolong survival of obese mice. Moreover  we report that when obesity was controlled by using pharmacological or dietary interventions  the levels of FASN  Cav  and P  gp were reduced which correlates with improvement in the effectiveness of DTIC on ectopic tumors in mice. Interest  ingly  weight control intervention profoundly increases the accumulation of DTIC in tumor and subsequently reduces its level in plasma and other tissues. These findings suggest that controlling adiposity body weight is beneficial towards the outcome of chemotherapy and may contribute towards reduction in generalized toxicity to organs. Additionally  this may also be helpful in preventing the development of drug resistant phenotype in cancers. Studies from in vitro and in vivo results conclude that stored fat  and adipokines  the adipocyte derived factors or hormones  aid in the progression of melanoma by up  regulating and driving multiple etiological pathways and regulating signaling cascades  . Adipokines can spe  cifically trigger several distinct transcriptional programs  those that promote tumorigenesis  cell survival and prolifer  ation  and angiogenesis and invasiveness  . Altered secretion profile of leptin  and adiponectin  and other in  flammatory adipokines such as IL  and TNF  by interact  ing with signaling network  accelerate neoplasia  . These factors by enhancing P gp may promote drug efflux  causing accumulation of drug in plasma and induce toxicity to vital organs. In addition  the nutrients and net available energy are also crucial factors that decide the fate of both normal and malignant cells. However  assessing net energy intake and expenditure is difficult to evaluate in humans. Nutrient signaling is an integral part of metabolic regulatory network and links nutrient availability with cell growth and prolifera  tion. Therefore  it is rational to target adipose tissue with antiobesity drug and energy restriction simultaneously. Using unique strategy by growing melanoma cells in ei  ther serum collected from obese mice treated or untreated with DTIC or orlistat  as well as in conditioned medium collected from adipocytes  we show that adipocyte secretory factors actually modulate the therapeutic response of melan  oma cells to DTIC. Adipocytes are also known to protect leukemia and breast cancer cells from chemotherapy and radiotherapy  respectively    . On the similar line  our study demonstrates that melanoma cells grown in the presence of serum collected from obese mice as well as in the CM collected from differentiated adipocytes cause an in  crease in IC   value of DTIC  suggesting that adipocyte  secreted factors adversely affect the outcome of chemother  apy. Melanoma cells grown under these conditions develop chemo resistant phenotype  characterized by increased ex  pression of FASN  Cav  and P gp. Inhibition of these mol  ecules reverses the chemo resistant phenotype induced by adipocyte secretory factors. These data imply that adipocyte  secreted factors are crucial in modulating important tumor  promoting molecules which  in turn  affect the outcome of cancer therapy. Collectively  these results suggest that  under obese state  melanoma cells in addition to acquiring a drug  resistant phenotype also develop aggressive proliferative phenotype  as compared to untreated counterparts.  chunk section section heading Conclusions  heading chunk This study provides a mechanistic link between obesity and the outcome of chemotherapy in melanoma through in  volvement of obesity associated factors  which alter the sta  tus of key signaling molecules involved in cell survival  proliferation  drug efflux  and drug resistance.

However  the impact of obesity and weight control interventions on the therapeutic response in melanoma is poorly understood. Methods  High fat diet  HFD induced obese mouse model was used in this study to evaluate the outcome of dacarbazine  DTIC  therapy in melanoma. We employed LC MS MS to determine the quantity of the drug in tumor  and in various tissues. Unique in vitro approach was used to complement in vivo findings by culturing melanoma cells in either conditioned medium  CM  obtained from differentiated adipocytes or in serum collected from experimental mice. Results  We report that diet induced obesity impairs the outcome of DTIC therapy and reduces overall survival in tumor bearing mice. We provide evidence that obesity restricts the accessibility of DTIC to tumor tissue. Critically  upon curtailing adiposity  accumulation and efficacy of DTIC is significantly improved. Moreover  using appropriate in vitro approaches  we show that melanoma cells exhibit a drug resistant phenotype when cultured in serum collected from diet induced obese mice or in CM collected from  T L  adipocytes. The impaired therapeutic response to DTIC in obese state is mediated by fatty acid synthase  FASN  caveolin   Cav  and P glycoprotein  P gp . The response to DTIC and overall survival were improved upon employing weight control interventions in the tumor bearing HFD fed  obese  mice. Conclusions  This study indicates that obesity not only supports rapid melanoma progression but also impairs the outcome of chemotherapy  which can be improved upon employing weight control interventions. From clinically relevant point of view  our study exemplifies the importance of lifestyle interventions in the treatment of obesity promoted cancers. ,1111,11.58055805580558
